...or How to use a 64-bit machine to control a Commodore 64.

{{< youtube L_Gdwa1DCD8 >}}

No schematics or PCBs yet. But at least I have theÂ materials that I'm using:

- One [Lolin NodeMCU](http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_trksid=p2050601.m570.l1313.TR0.TRC0.H0.Xlolin+nodemcu.TRS0&_nkw=lolin+nodemcu&_sacat=0) (should work with any other ESP8266 that have at least five GPIOs)
- Two 4066 ICs. I'm using [this one](http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/sn74hc4066.pdf).

...and this is the software that I'm using both for the NodeMCU firmware and the iOS client:

More info and upgrades coming soon.

#### Todo list:

- Support two joysticks at the same time (for multiplayer games)
- Support mouse
- Support paddle
- Save/Replay commands so that you can kind-of-replay your game
- Service discovery so that you don't have to hardcore the IP address
