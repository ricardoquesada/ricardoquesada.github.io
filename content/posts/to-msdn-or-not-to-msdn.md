A long time ago I was a Windows developer. I developed for user mode, kernel mode, win32 stuff, etc. And having a [MSDN subscription](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/default.aspx) was a _must-have_. Not only because Visual Studio was included, but also because you were able to download "debug" builds of the whole Operating System; and also you had access to all the Microsoft products in different localizations.

The MSDN subscription was expensive, but it was worth it.

But nowadays, since you can get the [Windows Phone SDK for free](https://dev.windowsphone.com/en-us/downloadsdk), perhaps the MSDN is no longer needed.

I'm currently using a MSDN Pro subscription (thanks MS for the gift).  And so far, the only feature that I'm using from the MSDN is Visual Studio 2013 Pro. I'll let you know if I happen to use more features from the MSDN.
