  The [Cromemco System Three](http://oldcomputers.net/cromemco-system-three.html) is a Z-80 based computer. Which is nice, because I always wanted to learn Z-80 (this is my second Z-80 computer, the other one is a MSX2).

  But What I like about the Cromemco is how well-built it is. I love it.

  The computer is that not big, but it is a very heavy computer.

  At the moment I don't have the needed cables to test it. If I can't find them, I might be able to build them myself (or not). If manage to get the cables, and provided that the computer works, I promise to write a game or something for it :)
