title: 'Machine-Embroidering Gun Fight Arcade in two T-shirts'
---

![gun_fight_tshirt](/images/gun_fight_two_tshirts.jpg)

This time the idea was to embroider the scene of the video game in two t-shirts. Each player is represented in each t-shirt.

For those not familiar with Gun Fight (Arcade, 1975) this is how it looks like:

So, when two people wears the two t-shirts at the same time, it looks like this:

Cute, isn't it ?

### How it was done

It was done doing something similar to what I did before with the Angler Fish:

- Grab the sprites from the game.
- Edit them with [GIMP].
- Create the path, pixel size, etc with my custom-made editor (Pixem)

![pixem](/images/gun_fight_pixem.png)

- Open it with [Inkscape][inkscape] and [Ink/Stitch][inkstitch]
- Export it to [PES][pes_file_format], to be used with my [Brother NQ3550W][brother_nq3550w]
- I used two [fusible iron no-show-mesh cut-away][fusible_stabilizer] stabilizers.
- I used a 75/11 embroidery needle.
- 650 SPM
- I machine-embroired one t-shirt. The fabric was cotton.
- The flipped horizontally the image.
- I machine-embroidered the other t-shirt. The fabric was kind of linen.

### The good, the bad and the ugly

- Good: I like how the big pixels look using "contour fill".
- Good: Single-color embroidery looks good. I'll try keep doing it.
- Neutral: I forgot to put the topping.
- Neutral: First time using 75/11 needles.
- Bad: Measure twice, embroider once. The white t-shirt is not centered. It moved while I was hooping it.
- Bad: The fusible iron no-shot-mesh cut-away stabilizer is too sticky for linen. It was very difficult to remove the "stickyness". I should try a non-fusible stabilizer next time.
