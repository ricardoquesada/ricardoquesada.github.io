With [PVM](http://pungas.space) with released an intro for the Tandy 1000 HX.

The Tandy 1000 HX uses the Intel 8088-2 CPU. Which is a suuuuper slow CPU (slower than the 8086). With all its wait states and its limitations on the video card (no hardware sprites, no charset redefinition) it makes it comparable with a Commodore 64. In fact, for certain things a Commodore 64 if way faster.

Without further ado, this is the Tandy intro:
