  For those not familiar with Unijoysticle 2, it is a device that allows you to use modern Bluetooth gamepads like [Sony DualSense](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/accessories/dualsense-wireless-controller/) or [Nintendo Switch controllers](https://store.nintendo.com/nintendo-switch/joy-con-controllers.html) (to name just a few) on old computers like the Commodore 64 or Amiga.

  What's new in version 2+:

  - Case friendly: lower profile, LEDs & buttons are close the border and has mounting holes.
  - Looks nicer: Uses SMD components for almost everything
  - Supports buttons 2 & 3 in port #2. Some Amiga games might use them.
  - Cheaper to manufacture. I reduced the price from $60 to $35

Notes:

- 1: Work-around: turn off the "self power" switch.
- 2: Tested with only one gamepad connected in "Basic" mode. In "Enhanced" mode, both draw ~102 mA.
- 3: Requires firmware update. Work in progress.

### The rationale behind the changes

**Barrel Jack removed:** It was no longer needed. It was added in the first revision of Unijoysticle 2 because "self-power" was not supported back then. But I added "self-power" in Rev. D, and the Barrel Jack was no longer needed. In case a user needs to power the device from an external source, the USB port can be used.

**Self-power switch removed:** I originally added this feature as a "just in case". And in fact, it fixes the ["C128 noise"](https://gitlab.com/ricardoquesada/unijoysticle2/-/issues/17) when the switch is off. In any case, a capacitor was added in Unijoysticle 2+ to prevent to noise, so the switch was no longer needed.

**Case friendly:** Many users requested a case for the Unijoysticle 2. I tried to design one, but it was not easy and I gave up. But it should be easier to design one for the 2+. BTW, I haven't designed one yet... but I should have one ready soonâ„¢.

**Kit vs assembled unit:** I'm only offering the Unijoysticle 2+ as an assembled unit. Doesn't make sense to offer a kit where most of the components are SMD.

**Price :** The new price for the assembled unit is $35 (from $60), and I'm no longer offering the Kit (which was $35). This is two-fold:

- Time (main reason): I'm using [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/) for manufacturing + assembly. This reduces the time that I have to spend on each unit.
- Components price: SMD components are slightly cheaper than through-hole ones. But on the other hand I'm using a 4-layer PCB which increases the price a little bit.

**Tindie:** To further reduce my time, I'm using Tindie as the store-front. Better for the users (don't have to send me an email), better for me (spend less time).

### This that hasn't changed

##### Open source / open hardware

- Firmware source code: [http://github.com/ricardoquesada/bluepad32](http://github.com/ricardoquesada/bluepad32)
- Hardware schematic + layout: [https://github.com/ricardoquesada/unijoysticle2](https://github.com/ricardoquesada/unijoysticle2)

Not only I'm making everything open source & open hardware so that you can create your own device, but I also welcome "competition". If you want to sell your own devices, please go ahead. All the profit is for you. Just let me know so that I can add your product in the ["3rd party devices" section](/unijoysticle2/).

##### Available for trade

I trade a Unijoysticle 2+ unit for one of your own retro inventions / creations. It works like this:

- I send you a Unijoysticle 2+ device (I pay the shipping)
- You send me one of your retro inventions/creations (you pay the shipping)
  - It could be a magazine, video game, device, etc... (must be retro-related)
