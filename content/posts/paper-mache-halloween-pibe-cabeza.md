My hand-made costume that I did for Halloween 2025.

He is "El Pibe Cabeza", a local superhero that saves kids from bullies.

Techniques used:

* Paper mache
* Acrylic painting
* Machine sewing
* Hand sewing
* Cardboard, wool yarn, hot glue, felt and more

I spent between 10 and 20 hours working on it with the help of the rest of the family.
