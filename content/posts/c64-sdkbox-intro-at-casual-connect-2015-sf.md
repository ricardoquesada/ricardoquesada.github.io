I did a quick'n'dirty intro for the C64 to promote [SDKBOX](http://sdkbox.com/) at [Casual Connect 2015 SF](http://usa.casualconnect.org/).

I took the scroller+rasterbar effects from the game that I'm doing, I took the music from somewhere, the fonts from somewhere, I added some simple moving bars at the top... and done. I only had one day to do it, and I was very happy with the result.

The demo ran during the 1st day of the conference on a NTSC C64-SX.
