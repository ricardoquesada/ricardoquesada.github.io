summary: "I assumed that the Commodore 1581 was failing because of a bad WD1772 IC (as documented in [Part I](https://retro.moe/2016/03/14/repairing-the-commodore-1581-floppy-disk-drive-part-1/)). So I ordered a WD1772 replacement + the IC socket, I developed some basic desoldering skills, watched some [desoldering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=239okViumdA) [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2j_8LvpTNk), and also got a cheap [desoldering iron from Radio Shack](https://www.radioshack.com/products/radioshack-45-watt-desoldering-iron?variant=5717855877):\n\n \n\nSo, I removed the board fromÂ the Commodore 1581 and started to desolder the IC. To my surprise the $11-buckÂ desolder iron worked pretty well.Â I was able to remove all the solder from the the pins in a few minutes. The desolder ironÂ just takes some time to reach the needed temperature, but besides that, it seems to be a great tool for occasional desoldering tasks (a hobbyist desoldering iron [cost more than $250](https://www.amazon.com/Hakko-FR300-05-P-Desoldering-Tool/dp/B00KWM69C4))"

So, I removed the board fromÂ the Commodore 1581 and started to desolder the IC. To my surprise the $11-buckÂ desolder iron worked pretty well.Â I was able to remove all the solder from the the pins in a few minutes. The desolder ironÂ just takes some time to reach the needed temperature, but besides that, it seems to be a great tool for occasional desoldering tasks (a hobbyist desoldering iron [cost more than $250](https://www.amazon.com/Hakko-FR300-05-P-Desoldering-Tool/dp/B00KWM69C4))

I removed the old WD1772 IC, solder an IC socket, installed the new WD1772 IC, assembled everything together again, plugged the Commodore 1581 into the Commodore 64, did a LOAD"$",8 and...

and got again the FILE NOT FOUND ERROR. Sigh.ðŸ˜ž

Time to double check everything:

- Did I solder the IC socket correctly? Did I clean the pin holesÂ correctly?
- Is there any traceÂ broken?
- What happens if I remove the WD1772? Will it behave the same way?
- And if the problem is not related to the WD1772, what's the origin of this problem?

Unfortunately I didn't have time to keep testing.
