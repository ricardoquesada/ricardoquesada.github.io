As a kid, I always avoided the Drean Commodore. I didn't like them because they
were not compatible with the NTSC software.

As an adult, I really wanted one basically because I'm from Argentina, and the
Drean was produced in Argentina. And I want to make sure that all the software
that I develop works on a Drean.

And in my lastest trip to Argentina I was able to get one :-) The condition of
the computer is Ok, neither great nor terrible. It works, although I need to do
more tests. Here are some photos:
