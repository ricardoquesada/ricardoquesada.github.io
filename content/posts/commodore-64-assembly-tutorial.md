A few months ago we released
the [Argentine Songbook Vol. 1](http://csdb.dk/release/?id=153497) chipdisk. And
recently we released its source code including:

- Full source code (the assembly files + makefiles + everything...)
- Full audio sources (the SidWizard files)

And we also wrote a tutorial about how to write a chipdisk, including all the
tricks that we used.
