I've been asked a few times which embroidery machine.
Here are the things to take into account:

## Budget and Hoop size

The bigger the hoop size, the more expensive it gets. As en example, here are 3 Brother models:

| Hoop Size (in) | Price   | Machines                                                          |
|----------------|---------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 4x4            | ~$500   | [Brother Skitch][brother_skitch], [Brother SE700][brother_se700]  |
| 5x7            | ~$1000  | [Brother PE900][brother_pe900]                                    |
| 6x10           | ~$2000  | [Brother NQ1700E][brother_nq1700e]                                |

It is worth noting that once you purchase a machine of a certain max hoop size, you are stuck with it.
You cannot replace the hoop with a bigger one and have a bigger embroidery area.
The limitation is in the mechanical arm.

## Online store vs local store

Embroidery machines are complex machines. If you are going to spend a considerable amount of money, might be better to
purchase it from a local store. Benefits:

* They teach you how to use it.
* Might give you some add-ons: threads, extra hoops, etc.
* Service the machine in case something goes wrong while the machine is under warranty.
* And last, but not least, you can negotiate the price. Specially for higher priced machines.

You can get a good price if you purchase it in a festival, for example, this one:
[Quilt, Craft and Sewing festival][festival].

## Brand

What I heard is:

* you should purchase a brand that you can service in your local area.
* has good support
* has a big community

Brother should be a good candidate.

But if you think that you can service the machine yourself, and you don't care that much about support, 
you can get an inexpensive machine with big hoops, like:

| Hoop Size (in) | Price   | Machines                        |
|----------------|---------|---------------------------------|
| 4x9.2          | ~$700   | [Poolin EOC05][poolin_eoc05]    |
| 7.9x11         | ~$1200  | [Poolin EOC06][poolin_eoc06]    |

## Single needle vs multi needle

Multi-needle machines are the best thing you can get. But they can be very
expensive.

As an example, a 12-needle machine (like the [Happy Japan HCS3][happy_japan_hcs3])
can cost ~14000.
(But don't forget to negotiate the price, it is like purchasing a car!).

Comparison between single-needle vs multi-needle:

| Feature       | Single needle                  | Multi needle            |
|---------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------|
| Color Changes | Manual                         | Automatic               |
| Workflow      | Babysit the machine            | "Set it and forget it " | 
| Construction  | Flat-bed (like sewing machine) | Tubular                 |
| Speed (SPM)   | Up to 850                      | > 1000                  | 
| Price         | ~$500 - $2000                  | ~$5000 - $20000+        |

### Color changes

On a single-needle machine, you have to manually re-thread your machine each time
that there is a color change.

On a multi-needle, since it has multiple needles already pre-threaded with the
correct color, you don't have to do anything when there is a color change.

###  Workflow

Single-needle machines require to babysit the machine.
Too many things can go wrong, so you have to be there and be ready to stop the
embroidery in case something wrong happens.

Multi-needle machines, due to their tubular construction + other features,
are much more robust and reliable, you don't have to babysit them.

### Construction

Tubular machines (multi-needle ones) have different benefits like:

* Easier to hoop.
* Possibility to hoop hats and sleeves.

### Speed

Multi-needle machines have a higher SPM (Stitches per minute).

### Price

But the big disadvantage is the price. Their usually start at $5000 and can go above $20000.

## Conclusion

As always, it depends on your budget, what you want to embroider, how often
you are going to use it, whether you want support / service, etc.

The obvious thing to recommend is, get a machine with the biggest hoop you can afford.
The rest varies on your needs, budget,

I can tell you that I got a [Brother NQ3550W][brother_nq3550w].
It is like the [NQ1700E][brother_nq1700e], but with the possibility to do
sewing as well.

I paid $2200 for it (including taxes).
It was around September 2024.
I got some extra threads and a hoop to embroider hats.

I use it about 2 or 3 times per month.

This is the only embroidery machine that I have, and so far I'm very happy with it.
Although sometimes I dream of having a multi-needle one.

## One last tip

If you are not in a hurry, wait for Black Friday season.
You might get a big discount.
