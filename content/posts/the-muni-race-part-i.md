A while ago, in 2008, I started coding a [unicycle video game](https://github.com/ricardoquesada/unigames) for the PC. I never finished it, but I always wanted to code one. And a few months ago I started coding the game again, but instead of coding it for the PC, I decided to code it for the Commodore 64.

I want to code the game in a retro style. Coding a Commodore 64 game is already retro, and I want to create a retro game for the Commodore 64, like if this game were coded in 1982 instead of 2015. So it would be something like a retro-retro game.

Developing code for the Commodore 64 takes a lot of time, and taking into account that my free time is almost null, my progress is very slow. But so far I managed to code the Intro and About scenes, and I started coding the game mechanics.

If you want try the game, you can download it from here: [https://github.com/ricardoquesada/c64-the-muni-race](https://github.com/ricardoquesada/c64-the-muni-race)
