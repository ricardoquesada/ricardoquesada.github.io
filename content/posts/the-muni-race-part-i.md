A while ago, in 2008, I started coding
a [unicycle video game](https://github.com/ricardoquesada/unigames) for the PC.
I never finished it, but I always wanted to code one.
And a few months ago I started coding the game again, but instead of coding it
for the PC,
I decided to code it for the Commodore 64.

I want to code the game in a retro style.
Coding a Commodore 64 game is already retro, and I want to create a retro game
for the Commodore 64, like if this game were coded in 1982 instead of 2015.
So it would be something like a retro-retro game.

Developing code for the Commodore 64 takes a lot of time,
and taking into account that my free time is almost null,
my progress is very slow.
But so far I managed to code the Intro and About scenes,
and I started coding the game mechanics.

If you want try the game, you can download it from here:
