Bluepad32 v4.0-beta.0 is released and contains many new features:

- [Raspberry Pi Pico W](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-pico/) support.
- BLE Service that allows a BLE client (mobile application) to configure
  Bluepad32. (BLE Client is still WIP).
- [More polished documentation](https://bluepad32.readthedocs.io/), hosted in readthedocs.
- Better directory structure (easier to find files).
- Easier way to create your own platform.
- Examples for raw ESP-IDF, Pico W and Linux, which use the new way of creating
  platform.
- [Github](https://github.com/ricardoquesada/bluepad32) is not the official
  repo, and [Gitlab](http://gitlab.com/ricardoquesada/bluepad32) is the backup (before it was the other way round).
- Some minor improvements in different places, and many bug fixes, that were
  discovered by just switching to [CLion IDE.](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/)
