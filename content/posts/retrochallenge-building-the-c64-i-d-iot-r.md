I started building the C64 I.D.IoT.R a few months ago, but never finished it.
What better than to finish it for the [Retro Challenge](http://www.wickensonline.co.uk/retrochallenge-2012sc/) contest.

C64 I.D.IoT.R is a smart light controlled from a C64. Its name means:

- C64: Commodore 64
- I: Intelligent
- D: Dimmer
- IoT: Internet Of Things:
- R: RRRRR

What I have done so far is this: (and is not part of the contest since I built it two months ago):

My goal for the Retro Challenge is to finish it. That includes:

- Somehow connect the printer header to the dimmer. Some gears + pulley will be needed.
- Use a SX64 instead of the C64 since it takes less space:
  That includes using an smaller version of the UniJoystiCle,
  since the current version (v0.2.2) doesn't fit.
  I also need a power cable from the user or extension port.
- Add voice control... something like: "Hey Commodore, turn off the lights".

Basically, I want to build something like this:
