title: 'Goodbye Wordpress, Hello Hugo'
---

I've been using Wordpress for many years. I started using it ~2008 to host cocos2d-iphone.org.
And then I used it for my personal blogs since it was what I knew.

But I've been wanting to switch to a static site generator for a while. And I finally did it. I'm now using Hugo.

The main problems that I had with Wordpress were $$$ and flexibility:

* I was already paying for forwarding my domain and for not having adds.
