Who remembers the Commodore 64 video game ["International Tennis"][international_tennis] ?

Although it was not one of my favorites games, I enjoyed playing it.

In any case, a friend of mine and a very good tennis player is moving abroad so I decided to give him a little present:

Even though this looks like an "easy" embroidery, the tricky part was the different pixel sizes:

I used the "layers" features from Pixem, where one layer had one pixel size, and the other a smaller one.
But in order to export the layers correctly I had to use some GIMP editing.
