- Seven colors: six polyester threads, one metallic thread
- End-to-end total time: ~7 hours
- 1 blinking LED running on [Lilypad Arduino][lilypad_arduino] board

Long story short, a few months ago I started a new hobby: machine-embroidery.
Since then, I've been experimenting with machine-embroidery pixel-art.

The Angler Fish is my 18th machine-embroidery pixel-art work.
Little by little, I've been improving my technique.
And in this post, I'm sharing my "best practices"

Steps:

1. Create a pixel-art design
2. Digitize the design
3. Get a %100 cotton T-shirt.
4. Pre-wash it
5. Iron it
6. Hoop it
7. Machine-embroidery it
8. Remove stabilizer
9. Wash it again
10. Iron it again

### 1. Pixel-art design

Prefer:

### 4. 100% cotton T-shirt

In theory, you can use a different type of fabric, but it is easier if you start
with non-stretchy fabrics.
So a 100% cotton t-shirt is a good starting place.

I'm using [Fruit of the Loop][fruit_of_loom] but any brand should do it.
