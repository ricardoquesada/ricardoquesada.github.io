Long story short, a few months ago I started a new hobby: machine-embroidery.
Since then, I've been experimenting with machine-embroidery pixel-art.

The Angler Fish is my 17th machine-embroidery pixel-art work.
And I believe the best one so far.

Here are the steps, including some tips and tricks, in case you want to do
something similar:

1. Create a pixel-art design
2. Digitize the design
3. Get a %100 cotton T-shirt. I'm using [Fruit of the Loop](https://www.fruit.com/) but any brand should do it.
4. Pre-wash it
5. Iron it
6. Hoop it
7. Machine-embroidery it
8. Remove stabilizer
9. Wash it again
10. Iron it again

### 1. Pixel-art design
