Today was the premier of the [_Growing the 8 Bit Generation_](http://www.8bitgeneration.com/) movie at the Computer History Museum. Great documentary about the 8-bit computers, focused on Commodore although it talks about Apple, Sinclair and Atari as well.

I went with my Commodore mug and I was able to to get Jeri's and Bil's autographs. Yeah!
