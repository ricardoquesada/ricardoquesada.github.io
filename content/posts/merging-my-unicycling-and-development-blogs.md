Who has time to maintain two personal blogs ? It is even difficult to maintain just one. So what I did was to merge my unicycle ( [monociclo.com.ar](http://www.moniclco.com.ar)) blog into this one ( [towp8.com](http://towp8.com)).

I divided them in categories:

- The unicycle blog is using the " [unicycle](http://towp8.com/category/unicycle/)" category.
- This blog is using the " [programming](http://towp8.com/category/programming/)" category
