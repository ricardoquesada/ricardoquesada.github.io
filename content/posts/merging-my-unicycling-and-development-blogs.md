Who has time to maintain two personal blogs ? It is even difficult to maintain just one. So what I did was to merge my unicycle ([monociclo.com.ar](http://www.moniclco.com.ar)) blog into this one ([towp8.com](http://towp8.com)).

I divided them in categories:

- The unicycle blog is using the "[unicycle](/category/unicycle/)" category.
- This blog is using the ~~"[programming](/category/programming/)"~~ category. **UPDATE 2025-07-28**: "[towp8](/category/towp8)"
