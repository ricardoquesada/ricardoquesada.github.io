Spot the difference.

Before:

After:

The former owner replaced the original SX-64 KERNAL (251104-04) with a C64 one (901227-02),
most probably to be 100% compatible with all the games.

But an SX-64 doesn't feel like an SX-64 without its unique colors.
That's why I replaced the KERNAL chip again, this time with the original one.
Actually, I couldn't find the original chip (the MOS 251104-04) anywhere, so instead,
I installed an EPROM chip with the original SX-64 KERNAL programmed into it.
