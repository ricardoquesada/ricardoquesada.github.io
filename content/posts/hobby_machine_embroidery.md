I did a lot of research before buying it. I watched a lot of YouTube videos,
read reviews, and visited a few stores to see the machines in person.

A few things to consider when buying an embroidery machine:

* ### Single-needle vs Multi-needle
  The most important decision is whether to buy a single needle or a
  multi-needle machine. Price is a big factor here.

  Multi-needle machines have a few advantages:

    * No need to change threads. This is a big time saver.
    * Easier to hoop: hoop stations, magnetic hoops, easier to hoop certain
      garments like hats, sleeves, etc.
    * Bigger hoop sizes
    * Usually they are faster

  But the drawbacks are:

    * More expensive
    * More complicated to use
    * Bigger and heavier

* ### Hoop Size
  The bigger the hoop size, the bigger the designs you can make.
  Make sure the machine you buy has the hoop size you need.
  If you purchase a machine with a hoop that is not big enough, you will be
  limited to that size. YOU CANNOT USE A BIGGER HOOP.


* ### Brand
  Brother is a well-known brand. They have a good reputation.
* ### Price
  The price range is huge. From a few hundred dollars to a few thousand.
  I wanted a good machine, but I didn't want to spend a fortune.
  The Brother NQ3550W is a good machine for the price.

## Sigle needle vs Multi-needle

Single needle machines are more common and cheaper. But I wanted a multi-needle.
