This past weekend, I had two events:

* [Vintage Computer Festival West][vcfwest], at the Computer History Museum.
* And we hosted a party at home.

So I decided that nothing better that to embroider Le Chuck,
from Monkey Island 2.

Here are the steps that I did to embroider it.

## 1. Grab the Sprite and simplify it

I took the sprite from [The Legend of Monkey Island][monkey_island_site] site.

<small>*Original sprite has 13 different colors.*</small>

I slightly modified it so that instead of using 13 colors, it uses 9.
I used [GIMP][gimp] to modify it.

## 2. Edit it with Pixem

I created the path-of-pixels (order in which the pixels are going to be
embroidered) in Pixem, my custom editor.

I also set:

- Pixel size: 4.2mm x 4.2mm
- Pull compensation: 0.2mm
- Min jump stitch length: 10mm, which in hindsight was too much. 
  More about this in a future blog post.

And from Pixem, I exported an SVG file with Ink/Stitch metadata.

## 3. Validate it with Ink/Stitch

I analyzed the SVG file with [Inkscape][inkscape] + [Ink/Stitch][inkstitch].
I checked that it looked good and I exported:

* PDF file: with the embroidery information, including a real-size of Le Chuck
* PES file: the one that my embroidery machine recognizes

## 4. Prepare the T-shirt

<small>*To center the hoop, I use a real-size printed version of Le
Chuck.*</small>

I used the 6x10 hoop. The hoop aspect ratio and the sprite aspect ratio were
almost the same one, yay!

It is recommended, when using the 6x10 hoop, to use [t-pins][t_pins] to prevent
a possible lateral movement. This time I forgot to put the pins. The good news
is that I didn't notice any "shift" in the final result.

I centered the hoop using a real-size printed version of Le Chuck.

As [before][thimbleweed], I used two layers
of [fusible iron no-show-mesh cut-away][fusible_stabilizer]
stabilizers. But this time I didn't iron them "too much". I only sprayed a tiny
bit of water while ironing them. And I'm happy with the result since it was
easier to cut and remove the stabilizers in the end.

I also used a [water-soluble embroidery topping][embroidery_topping] to make the
pixels look better.

## 6. Choosing the correct color threads

## 7. Embroider it!

And then I just embroidered it. I had to babysit the embroidery process since
many things could go wrong.

## 8. Trimming stabilizer and hreads

Once you finish with the embroidery, there are two remaining tedious tasks:

- Trimming the "extra" stabilizer
- Trimming the threads that are "hanging" usually due to jump stitches

## 9. Fixing "bugs"

As [before][thimbleweed], a fixed the "bug" by embroidering a "pixel" on top of
it.

## Success!
