This past weekend, I had two events:

* Vintage Computer Festival West, at the Computer History Museum.
* And we hosted a party at home

So I decided that nothing better that to embroider Le Chuck, from Monkey Island.

Here are the steps that I did:

## Grab the Sprite and simplify it

I took the sprite from [The Legend of Monkey Island][monkey_island_site].

<small>*Original sprite has 13 different colors.*</small>

I slightly modified it so that instead of using 13 colors, it uses 9.
I used [GIMP][gimp] to modify it.

## Pixem it

I created the path-of-pixels (order in which the pixels are going to be
embroidered) in Pixem, my custom editor.

And from Pixem, I exported an SVG file with Ink/Stitch metadata.

## Ink/Stitch it

I analyzed the SVG file with Inkscape + Ink/Stitch. 
I checked that it looked good and I exported:

* PDF file: with the embroidery information, including a real-size of Le Chuck
* PES file: the one that my embroidery machine recognizes

## bla

* Unique colors: 9
* Total thread use: 237.3m / 118.65m
