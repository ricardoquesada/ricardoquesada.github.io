*My dual boot Linux/Win machine. Not powerful enough for serious Win Phone development.*

Get a good, dedicated Windows machine. Not like this one. VMWare / Parallels is OKish… but I wouldn’t recommend it.

My current notebook has 2 big issues: Low performance and a low-quality trackpad. I remember when I switched from a Dell XPS 12" to a MacBook 13" around 2008. One thing that called my attention was the size of the MacBook's trackpad: it was huge. And now it is the opposite: I find that most Windows notebooks have a crappy  trackpad: too small and unresponsive.

So far, the closest thing that I found to a MacBook Retina is a [Dell XPS 15".](http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msusa/en_US/pdp/productID.288730000) It will arrive next week, and it will be my main Windows developer's machine. I'll let you know how good it is.

Apparently all new modern Windows notebooks come with a touchscreen. As a developer, I'm not interested in that feature at all. I wish I could remove the "touch" feature from the screen and pay less for the notebook.
