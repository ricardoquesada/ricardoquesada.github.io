Unijoysticle 2 A500 is a device that enables Bluetooth gamepads and mice on the Commodore Amiga.

It is similar in functionality to the [Unijoysticle 2+](/2021/10/20/introducing-unijoysticle-2/), but with some additional features tailored for the Amiga, like:

- Fits in the Amiga 500 / 1200 joystick port without additional cables
- New buttons:
  - "mode" button: To easily cycle between "normal", "mouse" and "enhanced" modes
  - "swap" button: To easily swap joystick ports. Useful in many scenarios, specially in the Amiga 4000 where the joystick ports are swapped.
- Additional LED for status: Tells whether Bluetooth pair is enabled, and in which gamepad mode is selected.

In addition to that, the firmware (Bluepad32) was updated to support:

- Mouse support: this was #1 feature request!
  - List of supported mice is here: [supported mice](https://bluepad32.readthedocs.io/en/latest/supported_mice/)
  - Supports up to two mice connected at the same time. Finally, you can play [Lemmings in two-player mode](https://lemmings.fandom.com/wiki/Lemmings_two-player)!
- Console support: useful to change settings in runtime like:
  - change mouse resolution
  - change autofire clicks-per-second
  - debug commands
  - and other [useful settings](https://github.com/ricardoquesada/unijoysticle2/blob/main/docs/user_guide.md#console)
- Improved re-connection on PlayStation and Switch gamepads.

See all the new Bluepad32 v3.5 features here: [Bluepad32 v3.5 released](/2022/07/10/bluepad32-v3-5-released/)

And last, but not least, the User Guide has been updated with new content, photos and videos to make it easier to read for the user:

You can also build one yourself. The hardware as well as the firmware are open source / open hardware:

- Firmware: [Bluepad32 source code](https://github.com/ricardoquesada/bluepad32)
- Hardware: [Schematic + layout files](https://github.com/ricardoquesada/unijoysticle2)

### It looks like this...

As you can see, it looks like the Unijoysticle 2+.

And you have to plug it in the joystick ports of your Amiga computer.

Amiga 1200 has enough current to self-power the Unijoysticle from the joystick ports. For the Amiga 500 you need to power it from the USB port.
