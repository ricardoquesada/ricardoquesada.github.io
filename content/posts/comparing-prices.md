Let's compare some prices.

iOS:

- [Xcode is free](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12)
- You have to [pay $99 per year](https://developer.apple.com/programs/ios/) in order to submit games to the AppStore.

Android:

- The [SDK and NDK](https://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html) are free
- There is a [$25 one-time-only fee](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/113468?hl=en) in order to submit games to Google Play

Windows Phone 8:

- [VS Express 2013](https://dev.windowsphone.com/en-us/downloadsdk) and Windows Phone 8 SDK are free. If you want something more complete, you can get VS Online Pro for [$45 per month,](http://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/visual-studio-online-professional-vs#Fragment_PricingHeader) or VS Pro (offline version) for [$499](http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msusa/en_US/pdp/Visual-Studio-Professional-2013/productID.284832200).
- You have to [pay $19 as an individual or $99 as a company](https://dev.windowsphone.com/en-us/join) per year in order to submit games to the Windows Store

Random thoughts:

- Price-wise, Android is the cheapest.
- Quality-wise, Android is also the cheapest. Developing for the NDK is very expensive (time-wise). So in the end developing for Android is much more expensive than developing for iOS (I don't know yet how expensive is to develop for WinPhone).
- iOS developers' experience is years ahead of Android's. Developing and debugging for Android's NDK reminds me when I was developing for Linux in the 90s. Google, come one, please give us a good C++ IDE for the NDK.
- You can develop Android apps using Mac, Windows or Linux. But you need a Mac to develop for iOS. And you need a PC in order to develop for Windows Phone.
- Xcode became a great IDE. Not only because of compiler improvements, but also of how well it is integrated with iOS: OpenGL Frame grabber, GPU analysis, memory leak detection, CPU profiler, etc.
- Six years ago, Visual Studio was the best IDE out there. It was way ahead of Xcode. I'm eager to use VS again. I'll let you know my findings.
