<p>In addition, Lucio and I¬†presented Cocos2d at¬†<a href="https://twitter.com/pyconar">PyCon Ar</a> 2008 and 2009.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/4Ou3F7RI7FCsvr3R7iFMSmpmWLZYwVJNSxE9LM4vZEt0vwnpUO20eZVDgAl5AkFtHJSaykuq7FbacZK57lTTIrEqNqkq8TLxoQvQUaAndIbTsvYoFuQKb2IjJ0w6L7ucQfrgsOg=-no"></p>
<p>Somewhere around¬†the beginning of 2008, Apple announced that the iPhone would have a store. Apple would only take 30% of the revenue (back then, carriers were taking around 90%). Furthermore, the iPhone was powered by OpenGL ES and the OS was UNIX based.</p>
<p>Also, around that time, I wanted to create commercial games. I had previously considered the Web (Flash) and feature phones (J2ME) as possible markets. But after Apple&rsquo;s announcement, I decided to develop games exclusively¬†for iPhone.</p>
<p>I needed a game engine for my iPhone games, so I re-wrote¬†Cocos2d in Objective-C. The high level design remained the same, but I had to make substantial¬†changes to make it work on the iPhone&hellip; ¬†and that is how &ldquo;cocos2d-iphone&rdquo; was born. The¬† first cocos2d-iphone version (v0.1) was released in June 2008.</p>
<p>In March 2008, I applied to get my iPhone Developers license, and <a href="/2008/09/18/el-largo-camino-a-la-licencia-de-iphone/">finally got it in July 2008</a>¬†(it took me 4 months to get one, whereas today you can get one in a few minutes). It was¬†not possible to publish games on the iPhone App without a license. While¬†waiting for my license, I did some contract work, developing some games for 3rd parties using cocos2d-iphone.</p>
<p>Having gotten¬†my iPhone Developers license, I created my first (and only) game for the iPhone: <a href="https://github.com/sapusmedia/Sapus-Tongue">Sapus Tongue.</a> However, I realized¬†that creating commercial games was not that fun for me; neither did I find it easy. Since¬†cocos2d-iphone was already popular, I decided to work full time on it. The reason I could do this is that I was actually making a living by <a href="https://web-beta.archive.org/web/20110529144259/http://www.sapusmedia.com:80/products/">selling two commercial tools</a>¬†for cocos2d-iphone:¬†<a href="https://github.com/sapusmedia/LevelSVG">LevelSVG</a>: a sort of editor + physics on top of cocos2d, and¬†<a href="https://github.com/sapusmedia/Sapus-Tongue">Sapus Tongue source code</a>.</p>
<p>At the beginning of 2009 there were already more than 100 games using cocos2d-iphone. The first one to reach #1 at the iPhone App Store was <a href="http://www.erichartzog.com/blog/creating-stickwars">Stick Wars</a>.</p>
<figure>
    <img loading="lazy" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/5F8wGUMT8E3nXmVZVbLVK4kG%5FbIBbuQHa0cwI9VAZIN0dm2d8Hd6YkCZK0H2y8Zp8N%5F771QHJunbIJ8vFr5onjx7m-heWEWNdsxKmQ5w16yTJ6wSuF1o9aNlF-A71Dz86bcV4ek=-no" width="480"/> 
</figure>

<p>After that, many other cocos2d-iphone games reached #1. And most of the time, there was at least one cocos2d-iphone game in the Top #10. I believe¬†this was the case from 2009 until the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20130502004847/http://www.cocos2d-iphone.org/archives/1496">end of 2011</a>.</p>
<p>Not only games¬†were created with cocos2d-iphone, but also animated books, photo applications, and more. Some cocos2d-iphone games and applications were featured at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130502035554/http://www.cocos2d-iphone.org/archives/996">WWDC 2010</a>. Even games that Apple proudly announced as &ldquo;built using Apple libraries&rdquo;, were actually built with¬†cocos2d-iphone.</p>

<p>Many cocos2d-iphone <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111021045559/http://www.cocos2d-iphone.org/archives/1155">forks/ports/bindings were created</a> as well, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>At least two Java ports: <a href="https://code.google.com/archive/p/cocos2d-android/">cocos2d-android</a>¬†and <a href="https://github.com/ZhouWeikuan/cocos2d">cocos2d-android-1</a></li>
<li>A C++ port: <a href="http://www.cocos2d-x.org">Cocos2d-x</a></li>
<li>Two JavaScript ports: <a href="https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-html5">Cocos2d-HTML5</a> and¬†<a href="https://github.com/RyanWilliams/cocos2d-javascript/">Cocos2d-JavaScript</a></li>
<li>Three C# ports: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100227225817/http://github.com/city41/cocosnet">CocosNet</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Cocos2DXNA/cocos2d-xna">Cocos2d-XNA</a>, <a href="https://github.com/mono/CocosSharp">CocosSharp</a></li>
<li>A Go port:¬†<a href="https://code.google.com/archive/p/gocos2d/">Gocos2d</a></li>
<li>Python bindings (bindings for cocos2d-iphone and <a href="https://github.com/seewindcn/pycocos2d">for cocos2d-x</a>) and Python port (a new port based on cocos2d-iphone, and not on the original Cocos2d)</li>
<li>Ruby bindings: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111021044117/http://www.cocos2d-iphone.org/wiki/doku.php/shinycocos:faq">ShinyCocos</a>¬†and support for¬†<a href="https://github.com/scottymac/rubymotion-cocos-tests">RubyMotion</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In July 2011, after working on cocos2d-iphone for more than 3 years, and with the help of the community, I released¬†<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111007164432/http://www.cocos2d-iphone.org/archives/1528">cocos2d-iphone v1.0</a>.¬† Some stats:¬†<a href="https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-iphone-classic/blob/v2.2/AUTHORS#L441">~140 contributors</a>, ~2600 commits and <a href="https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-iphone-classic/blob/v2.2/CHANGELOG#L599">63 internal releases</a>.</p>

</figure>

<p>The community was very¬†healthy, with many people helping each other, opening bug reports, sending pull requests, suggesting features, etc. The ecosystem around cocos2d-iphone was also very healthy: many cocos2d-iphone books were published, and many editors/tools (both commercial and free/open source) supported cocos2d-iphone, many job positions were looking for cocos2d-iphone developers.</p>
<p>In May 2011, I joined Zynga. At Zynga¬†we used cocos2d-iphone for some iOS games. To port them to Android, some of them were rewritten using¬†<a href="http://www.andengine.org/">AndEngine</a>, and others were ported using¬†<a href="http://www.apportable.com/">AppPortable</a>&rsquo;s Objective-C/UIKit stack.</p>
<p>In 2012, Android was already very strong. I wanted to support Android natively (and other platforms as well). I had three¬†options:</p>
<ol>
<li>Stop working on cocos2d-iphone, and work on Cocos2d-x (the C++ fork)</li>
<li>Keep developing cocos2d-iphone, and use 3rd party commercial Objective-C stack (like <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20130502012020/http://www.cocos2d-iphone.org/archives/2013">StellaSDK</a>, <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20130502015911/http://www.cocos2d-iphone.org/archives/1774">NoodleCake</a>¬†or <a href="http://www.apportable.com/">AppPortable</a>) to port cocos2d-iphone to Android</li>
<li>Keep developing cocos2d-iphone, and develop an open source Objective-C stack to port cocos2d-iphone to Android.</li>
</ol>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t want to depend on 3rd party¬†commercial tools, and I didn&rsquo;t have the time to write my own Objective-C stack, and Cococs2d-x was already popular. So I decided to help¬†the¬†Cocos2d-x team. We¬†started using Cocos2d-x at Zynga as well.</p>
<figure>
    <img loading="lazy" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/K05MOzKn8QE3Vn8s64X1p7CfrWuMfNaQyweNLpwMsa7E%5FJ50l-MFEXYxEV2N0XcsCbFdMQkqCl4L6%5FPDJYc0NNptx3ojm9qkVpDaSfjAN5rfqQwdc5BNwSvlxMkmHtzXvmlDH1E=-no" width="512"/> 
</figure>

<p>At Zynga, with the help of the Cocos2d-x team, we created a very attractive tooling:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cocos2d-x and cocos2d-iphone were feature compatible. The API was almost the same (of course, one in C++ and one in Objective-C)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/cocos2d/CocosBuilder">CocosBuilder</a> (created by Viktor Lidholt) included many good¬†features: Scene editor, key-frame animation editor, JavaScript scripting and more.</li>
<li>Scenes exported by CocosBuilder were supported both by cocos2d-iphone and Cocos2d-x.</li>
</ul>
<figure>
    <img loading="lazy" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/TCOj1fzRAc9uQVCfFWksM3BFI2SImRIUutG0kJYhJwtZAURrYRsuI0mFdOw5xF3QfMEbCca7icesfykHTIXQ1%5FGMyuY4pw%5FPl1r0JZYjC9skZQBBaBTa4Ss9f0ViTFeVU%5FgPpkA=-no" width="512"/> 
</figure>

<p>The only drawback was that keeping feature-compatibility between Cocos2d-x and cocos2d-iphone was expensive: we had to write the features¬†twice. And also CocosBuilder was built on top of cocos2d-iphone which meant it was only available for Mac (no Windows version), and also required writing the features twice. Supporting Windows¬†was important for many Cocos2d-x users.</p>
<p>I kept developing cocos2d-iphone until June 2013, and then¬†<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20140208064401/http://www.cocos2d-iphone.org/welcome-birkemose-the-new-cocos2d-iphone-lead-developer-maintainer/">I passed the¬†torch to Lars Birkemose</a>¬†(who in 2016 passed it again to Andrei Volodin). In¬†August 2013 I joined¬†Chukong.</p>

Cocos Studio was developed at Beijing. Cocos2d-x is being¬†developed in Xiamen (south of China), and I joined their California office were we did a bit of everything.</em></p>
<p>Cocos2d-x was started by Zhe Wang in July 2010. It was a clone of cocos2d-iphone, but coded in C++ instead of Objective-C. His goal was to create an SDK to facilitate porting¬†cocos2d-iphone games to the uPhone (a phone project that was later cancelled). In order to facilitate the porting, Cocos2d-x included all the Objective-C patterns that were found in cocos2d-iphone. Somewhere in 2012 (or was it 2011?) the Cocos2d-x team joined Chukong.</p>
<p>Chukong had the resources, the willing, and the position to make¬†Cocos2d-x a world class game engine / tooling. Cocos2d-x, back in 2013, had about between 70%~80% of the Chinese market share.</p>
<p>At¬†Chukong, we started by designing Cocos2d-x v3, which included the removal¬†of Objective-C patterns from its code, the use of¬†modern C++ APIs, the update of¬†the renderer (Nite), the addition of¬†3d features (Tony and Harrison) and the writing of¬†a¬†<a href="http://www.cocos2d-x.org/docs/programmers-guide/about/">Programmers Guide</a>¬†(Jason).</p>
<p>But the most important thing was the editor: We needed one. Chukong had invested a lot of resources in <a href="http://www.cocos2d-x.org/wiki/Cocos_Studio">Cocos Studio</a>. It had many features, but its UX wasn&rsquo;t appealing for the US/Western market, and it was Windows only.</p>
<p>So, in the US office, we (Justin, Nite and Kai) started working from scratch on an editor for Cocos2d-x both for the Chinese and US/Western markets¬†(something similar to CocosBuilder, but built on top of Cocos2d-x and compatible with Windows and Mac. <a href="https://www.qt.io/">Qt</a> was used for this).</p>

</figure>

<p>Unfortunately the new editor was cancelled. As¬†hard as we tried to improve Cocos Studio&rsquo;s UX, it failed to attract the¬†US/Western market.</p>

</figure>

<p>Other projects were cancelled as well, such as Cocos2d-HTML5 v4, Cocos2d-x v4 renderer + HAL, Cocos2d-x launcher, Cocos IDE. Even¬†Cocos Studio got cancelled.</p>

</figure>

<p>Cancelling projects, specially when they are almost ready, can¬†be frustrating. But our main¬†challenge¬†was finding a good business model. We tried different things, but we couldn&rsquo;t find a good one.</p>
<p>In hindsight, this is what I think we should have done:</p>
<ul>
<li>Work on just one editor: the¬†Qt editor that was supposed to be the Cocos Studio replacement.</li>
<li>Offer services within the editor: <a href="http://www.cocos2d-x.org/sdkbox">SDKBOX</a>, and other services.</li>
<li>Focus: Only¬†work on casual/mid-core features (no VR or¬†other distracting features). Try to be the best ones in that category.</li>
</ul>
<p>After working 9 years on Cocos2d, <a href="http://discuss.cocos2d-x.org/t/farewell-to-our-friends-chukong-u-s-office-is-closing-march-31-2017/34809">and due to¬†the development of recent events</a>, the time has come for me to work on something else.¬†What should I do next? Some people say that the future is IoT, others say it is Machine Learning,¬†while the rest¬†say it is VR/AR. They are all wrong: The future is the Commodore 64. See you soon.</p>
