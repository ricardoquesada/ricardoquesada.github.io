And I use this one-bit of data to turn on/off the rumble in the gamepads through the Unijoysticle.\n(Note: Spanish version of the video is here)\nHow does it work I strongly suggest to view the video (see above) which contains technical info starting at 1:24\nAs a summary it works like this:\nThe SID generates pulses that goes from 0 to ~1.3v every ~520us Those pulses go to the Joystick POT lines The pulses can be filtered from the CIA #1, Port A, Pins 6 and 7. The Unijoysticle receives the pulses and with the help of a timer and pull-up resistors it does the following: If the line is High, turn on Rumble. Otherwise turn it off. So, in order to turn on/off the rumble, we just need to do this in our games:\n; ; Example that shows all 4 possible combinations ; lda #%00000000 ;turn off rumble in both ports sta $dc00 lda #%01000000 ;turn on rumble in port 1. Port #2 is Off sta $dc00 lda #%10000000 ;turn on rumble in port 2. Port #1 is Off sta $dc00 lda #%10000000 ;turn on rumble in both ports sta $dc00 Note: What this discovery is about, is that by combining different well-known C64 features, we can now use to send 1-bit of data to the Joystick ports. For those who are curious about how the ADC works, read this article: Commo Pad, or just Google \u0026ldquo;Mouse 1351 internals\u0026rdquo;.\nThe different parts The project consist of three parts:\nUnijoysticle Flashparty edition Bluepad32: The firmware that runs inside the Unijoysticle device (requires v3.5.1 or newer) Modified games: Rambo and Lemans Unijoysticle 2 Flashparty edition This board is based on the original Unijoysticle 2 board, and includes the following changes:\nLines that connects to the POT lines Some external pull-up resistors Improved layout Schematic and Layout files can be found here: unijoysticle2_flashparty2022\nBluepad32 v3.5.1 This is the firmware that runs in the Unijoysticle device.\nIncludes the code needed to read the POT lines and turn on/off the rumble accordingly. Pre-compiled binary can be found here: bluepad32-unijoysticle_v3.5.1\nRambo: First Blood, Part II Things that I did to the game:\nTook the NTSC (ThunderMountain) version and cracked it Disassembled the game and added comments to it Patched it to support rumble Make it easier to switch weapons (Put Unijoysticle in \u0026ldquo;Enhanced\u0026rdquo; mode!). Works by pressing space as well. Added intro and converted it to a single-file game While doing it I discovered Martin Galway\u0026rsquo;s Music Debug routine that can be accessed by pressing \u0026lsquo;P\u0026rsquo; in the intro. While in the Music Debug routine, press letters A to Z to turn on the different songs. \u0026lsquo;1\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;2\u0026rsquo; switches the different music bank songs.\nThe complete disassembled code can be found here:\nhttps://gitlab.com/ricardoquesada/c64-rambo Lemans Things that I did to the game:\nTook the original cartridge binary, disassembled it and fully commented it Patched it to support rumble Patched other things like: Use joystick instead of paddle, fixed typo in message and other minor things Added intro The complete disassembled code can be found here:\nhttps://gitlab.com/ricardoquesada/c64-lemans Flashparty This project was presented at Flashparty 2022 (a demoscene event), where it got 2nd place in the Wild category.\nMany thanks for the organizers, who also setup a Commodore 64 with the Unijoysticle Flashparty edition so that the public can try it.\nThe \u0026ldquo;Retro Station\u0026rdquo; at Flashparty with a C64 + Unijoysticle\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2022/10/02/gamepad-rumble-support-for-the-commodore-64/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI discovered a way to send 1-bit of data from the Commodore 64 to the Joysticks.

In \u0026ldquo;Enhanced\u0026rdquo; mode, both draw ~102 mA. 3: Requires firmware update. Work in progress. The rationale behind the changes Barrel Jack removed: It was no longer needed. It was added in the first revision of Unijoysticle 2 because \u0026ldquo;self-power\u0026rdquo; was not supported back then. But I added \u0026ldquo;self-power\u0026rdquo; in Rev. D, and the Barrel Jack was no longer needed. In case a user needs to power the device from an external source, the USB port can be used.\nSelf-power switch removed: I originally added this feature as a \u0026ldquo;just in case\u0026rdquo;. And in fact, it fixes the \u0026ldquo;C128 noise\u0026rdquo; when the switch is off. In any case, a capacitor was added in Unijoysticle 2+ to prevent to noise, so the switch was no longer needed.\nCase friendly: Many users requested a case for the Unijoysticle 2. I tried to design one, but it was not easy and I gave up. But it should be easier to design one for the 2+. BTW, I haven\u0026rsquo;t designed one yet\u0026hellip; but I should have one ready soon™.\nKit vs assembled unit: I\u0026rsquo;m only offering the Unijoysticle 2+ as an assembled unit. Doesn\u0026rsquo;t make sense to offer a kit where most of the components are SMD.\nPrice : The new price for the assembled unit is $35 (from $60), and I\u0026rsquo;m no longer offering the Kit (which was $35). This is two-fold:\nTime (main reason): I\u0026rsquo;m using JLCPCB for manufacturing + assembly. This reduces the time that I have to spend on each unit. Components price: SMD components are slightly cheaper than through-hole ones. But on the other hand I\u0026rsquo;m using a 4-layer PCB which increases the price a little bit. Tindie: To further reduce my time, I\u0026rsquo;m using Tindie as the store-front. Better for the users (don\u0026rsquo;t have to send me an email), better for me (spend less time).\nThis that hasn\u0026rsquo;t changed Open source / open hardware Firmware source code: http://gitlab.com/ricardoquesada/bluepad32 Hardware schematic + layout: https://gitlab.com/ricardoquesada/unijoysticle2 Not only I\u0026rsquo;m making everything open source \u0026amp; open hardware so that you can create your own device, but I also welcome \u0026ldquo;competition\u0026rdquo;.

The binary, without any kind of modification, can run both on:\na 80386 (or better) + DOS and on a Commodore 64. We ( L.I.A) released it at Flashparty 2021. I did the coding.\nMulti-platform internals A bit of context:\nDOS: A .com file has no header. The first byte of the .com is code: this first byte will get executed first. C64: A .prg file has a header of two bytes. These two bytes indicate the load address of program. E.g: If the first two bytes are 0x01 and 0x08, it means that program will be loaded at address: 0x0801. Taking that into account, there are different ways to support both DOS and C64 at the same time:\nUsing the standard 0x0801 address (the one used by this intro). Or autorun: using an address like 0x02NN, where NN could be any of the single-byte instructions. E.g: A good candidate for autorun could be 0x02cc. Let\u0026rsquo;s see in detail how using 0x0801 start address work:\n$01 $08 ; Start Address ($0801) $0b $08 ; Next basic instruction: Address $080b $75 $08 ; BASIC line number. E.g: 2165, but could be any number $9e ; BASIC \u0026#34;SYS\u0026#34; token $32 $32 $32 $34 ; \u0026#34;2224\u0026#34; $00 ; End of line $00 $00 ; Address: $080b. End of BASIC program In summary, the first two bytes are fixed: $01 $08. Bytes 2 and 3 can be somewhat controlled. Bytes 4 and 5 can be fully controlled. \u0026hellip;and the rest is not important since we can fully control bytes 4 and 5. If we disassemble our C64 program like if it were a DOS .com, it would look like:\n.org 0x100 ; Assumes: (see: http://www.fysnet.net/yourhelp.htm) ; BX=0x0000 ; CX=0x00ff ; SI=0x0100 add [bx + si], cx ; Bytes $01 08$ or cx, [bx + si] ; Bytes $0b $08 ; we control the next 2 bytes: $0875 (2165) ; Meaning that the BASIC line will be 2165 ; \u0026#34;Z\u0026#34; won\u0026#39;t be set, so the jump is guaranteed. jnz start ; Bytes $75 $08 db 0x9e ; BASIC \u0026#34;SYS\u0026#34; opcode db 0x32, 0x32, 0x32, 0x34 ; \u0026#34;2224\u0026#34; or 0x08b0: C64 start address db 0x00 ; End of line db 0x00, 0x00 ; End of BASIC program start: ;Our start code The first 2 instruction could potentially break our DOS program. But if you look at the initial values of BX, SI and CX, it is safe to assume that:\nBX = 0x0000 SI = 0x0100 CX = 0x00FF What will happen is that the first instruction will overwrite itself, and the second will overwrite CX. The OR will set Z=0. And the following instruction will jump to our start address.\nThe generated binary will run both on a DOS machine and on a C64. This technique does not use any emulator trick. The binary runs in real hardware.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s nice about this technique is that it doesn\u0026rsquo;t add any overhead: no additional bytes are needed to support both platforms.\nChallenge: Create a binary that can run in 3 different platforms.\nSize distribution The 256 bytes of the intro are distributed like the following:\nGreen: C64 bootstrap ( SYS 2224), 14 bytes (~5%) Blue: DOS code, 112 bytes (~43%) Pink: C64 scroller text, 51 bytes (~20%) Red: C64 code, 79 bytes (~30%) Total:\nDOS: 112 bytes (~43%) C64: 14 + 51 + 79: 144 bytes (~57%) Download + Source code + Misc links Binary is available here:\namor_para_dos_lia2.zip Commented source code is available here:\nhttps://gitlab.com/ricardoquesada/c64-pc-intro-amor-para-dos Misc links:\nPouet: https://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=89786 CSDB: https://csdb.dk/release/?id=207946 ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2021/09/05/a-multi-platform-256-byte-intro/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCzAlfXOOXo\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCzAlfXOOXo\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Amor para Dos\u0026rdquo; is a multi-platform 256-byte intro.

In order to use WiFi, you would use:\nWiFiNINA library, in Arduino ESP32SPI library, in CircuitPython These two libraries (WiFiNINA and ESP32SPI) have the same functionality. In fact they are compatible. The only difference is that WiFININA is written in C++ , and ESP32SPI in Python.\nThe co-processor (ESP32) comes pre-flashed with the Arduino NINA firmware.\nThe ESP32 (A) connects to the internet using WiFi. And then sends the data back to the main processor (B). It uses a protocol that has some predefined messages like:\nOpen HTTP connection and get data Enumerate SSID networks Connect to SSID network etc. How does Bluepad32 work Now that we know how WiFi works, it is easier to explain how Bluepad32 works. Similar to WiFi, Bluepad32 has two main parts:\nBluepad32 firmware Bluepad32 library The gamepad connects to the ESP32 (A) using Bluetooth. And the ESP32 (A) sends the gamepad data to the main processor (B). It uses the same protocol used by the NINA firmware, but with some extended messages like:\nGet gamepad data Set rumble on gamepad Set player LEDs on gamepad etc. Bluepad32 firmware has the following features:\nHas Bluetooth gamepad support Runs on the co-processor (ESP32) Replaces the Arduino NINA firmware Uses the same NINA firmware protocol There are two variants of the firmware: Bluepad32 firmware for NINA co-processors Bluepad32 firmware for AirLift co-processors Bluepad32 library has the following features:\nRuns on the main processor Fetches that gamepad data from the co-processor There are two version of the library: Bluepad32 library for Arduino [Bluepad32 library for CircuitPython](http://Bluepad32 library for CircuitPython) How to use it in Arduino Bluepad32 library is part of the official Arduino library registry, so, you can install like any other Arduino library:\nArduino IDE -\u0026gt; Tools -\u0026gt; Manage Libraries -\u0026gt; Search for \u0026ldquo;bluepad32\u0026rdquo; and install.\nAnd it comes already with an example that shows how to use it:\nArduino IDE -\u0026gt; File -\u0026gt; Examples -\u0026gt; Bluepad32 -\u0026gt; Gamepad\nTo flash the Bluepad32 firmware in your Arduino board, please follow these instructions:\nHow to flash Bluepad32 firmware for NINA co-processors How to use it in CircuitPython Bluepad32 library is part of the official CircuitPython Community Library Bundle. You can install it like any other CircuitPython library. Install circup and then do:\n$ circup install bluepad32 This example shows how to use Bluepad32 library for CircuitPython:\nbluepad32_simpletest.py And to flash the Bluepad32 firmware in your CircuitPython board, please follow these instructions:\nHow to flash Bluepad32 firmware for AirLift co-processors NINA vs AirLift vs ESP32 NINA-W10x are ESP32 modules. They are similar in functionality to the ESP32-WROOM-32 modules. Although the NINA modules are built by u-blox, and not by Espressif (do not confuse a ESP32 module with the ESP32 chip).\nu-blox, in addition to the NINA-W10x modules, makes other modules that are not ESP32-based. But for the sake of simplicity, in this article, when we mention \u0026ldquo;NINA\u0026rdquo;, we talk about the NINA ESP32-based modules.\nThe NINA modules come pre-flashed with the Arduino NINA firmware, and in order to talk to them, you use the the WiFiNINA library.\nMakes sense, it is consistent:\nModule name: NINA-W10x Firmware name: [Arduino NINA-W10x firmware](http://Arduino NINA-W102 firmware) Library name: WiFiNINA AirLift modules, on the other hand, are ESP32-WROOM-32 modules. I guess \u0026ldquo;AirLift\u0026rdquo; was created as a marketing name. But what is confusing is that they come pre-flashed with a fork of the Arduino NINA firmware, and the library name is called ESP32SPI.\nIt is confusing:\nModule name: AirLift Firmware name: Adafruit NINA-W10x firmware (fork of Arduino\u0026rsquo;s). Library name: ESP32SPI (Adafruit, if you are reading, I\u0026rsquo;d rename them to \u0026ldquo;AirLift firmware\u0026rdquo;, and \u0026ldquo;AirLift library\u0026rdquo;).\nWhether it is a NINA-W10x, an AirLift module or an ESP32-WROOM32, all of them have the ESP32 chip inside. And all of them can run the NINA firmware, or the Bluepad32 firmware, or mostly any other ESP32 firmware that are out there.\nSo, if all of them are ESP32-based, and if WiFiNINA and ESP32SPI library are compatible, why did Adafruit fork Arduino\u0026rsquo;s NINA firmware? So far, the only incompatibility that I found, is that the MOSI pin (from SPI) is different.\nNINA uses GPIO 12 for MOSI AirLift uses GPIO 14 for MOSI GPIO 12 is strapping pin, and at boot time it is used internally by the ESP32.

Easy to program, a must. Chosen: Python, in particular CircuitPython Gamepad support: Multiple gamepads at the same time (multiplayer is a must).

Let\u0026rsquo;s see what we can do in this extremely low-resolution screen. A powerful enough micro-controller: Chosen: Matrix Portal M4, mostly for convenience since it comes with an ARM Cortex M4, ESP32, \u0026ldquo;expansion port\u0026rdquo; + header to connect to the matrix LED. It already supports CircuitPython. As a bonus it has an accelerometer. Portability: It should be portable, no need to use an external power supply. In other words, I\u0026rsquo;m building a Nintendo Switch killer. What will happen next is that Nintendo will run out of business. If this happens, my 7-year-old kid will kill me, since his dream is to be a video game designer at Nintendo\u0026hellip; so probably I shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be that aggressive in my marketing campaign.\nAdding music support: the SN76489 chip https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a8/SN76489_01.jpg\nThe SN76489 is a \u0026ldquo;chiptune\u0026rdquo; music chip that was used in many video game consoles and computers back in the 80\u0026rsquo;s. It is the ideal candidate for the \u0026ldquo;modern retro console\u0026rdquo; because:\nIt is easy to get one: Ebay, Aliexpress It is cheap: ~$1 It is easy to program Songs don\u0026rsquo;t take that much space 3 \u0026ldquo;square\u0026rdquo; channels + 1 noise The MatrixPortal M4 \u0026ldquo;expansion\u0026rdquo; bus MatrixPortal M4 has 11 lines that can be used to expand (and debug) the board. In our case, we are going to use the A1-A4 lines to control the SN76489 chip.\nAccording to the schematic, these 4 lines (A1-A4) are SERCOM lines, meaning that they can be used for SPI among other things. And in the SAMD51 datasheet, we can see that A1 (real name is PA05) can be used as clock, and A2 (real name is PA04) as MOSI ( not every combination is valid).\nWe are going to use SPI to drive a 74HC595, which is a serial-to-parallel chip. And the 74HC595 will connect to the SN76489. This is the schematic:\nThe most important to keep in mind is how the Matrix Portal is connected to the 74HC595:\nA1 \u0026lt;\u0026ndash;\u0026gt; SRCLK in 74HC595 A2 \u0026lt;\u0026ndash;\u0026gt; SER (MOSI) in 74HC595 A3 \u0026lt;\u0026ndash;\u0026gt; RCLK in 74HC595 A4 \u0026lt;\u0026ndash;\u0026gt; /WE in SN76489 The rest is very similar to other existing schematics. E.g: this one from Aidan Lawrence:\nhttps://github.com/AidanHockey5/ESP8266_VGM_Player BOM:\n1 x SN76489 1 x 74HC595 1 x 3.579545MHz oscillator 1 x LM386 audio amplifier module 1 x 3-watt, 8-ohm speaker I chose a 3.579545Mhz oscillator to be compatible with IBM PC Jr / Tandy 1000. But you can choose any oscillator up to 4.0 Mhz.\nSN76489 pinout If you have never used a SN76489 before, then pay special attention to the pinout!\nThe answer is: both. The left one is using the lines in MSB (WTF Texas Instruments!) and the right one is in LSB. If that is confusing, then just use the one from the right!\nSince I did the wiring in the wrong order (I used the left pinout without knowing it was in MSB order) and was too lazy to re-wire it, I \u0026ldquo;fixed\u0026rdquo; it in software by converting MSB \u0026lt;\u0026ndash;\u0026gt; LSB while writing the data to the 74HC595:\nmusic76489.py hack Notice that I\u0026rsquo;ll remove the hack in the future, once the wiring is fixed.\nPlaying music from CircuitPython The good thing about using SPI, is that we can do everything from Python, without resorting to C. CircuitPython already has a library to drive the 74HC595, so it was pretty easy to support it.\nI wrote a simple python library to play VGM music files.\nmusic76489.py And they way to use it is very simple:\nimport music76489 m = music76489.Music76489() m.load_song(\u0026#39;my_song.vgm\u0026#39;) while True: # This is your game main loop m.play() The complete source code of the game that appears in the video is here:\ncode_snake.py Creating your own song For the time being, the music library plays VGM sound files (more coming, see down below).\nVGM files can be created with different \u0026ldquo;trackers\u0026rdquo;. I recommend using the Deflemask tracker since it is free and multiplatform.\nhttps://www.deflemask.com/deflemask_full_7.png\nWhereas writing a Deflemask tutorial is outside the scope of this project, you should basically target the SN76489 chip (Sega Master System) at 3.579545Mhz (NTSC) if you want to give it a try.\nMore information about VGM here:\nVGM file format What\u0026rsquo;s next Polish the code: remove hacks, cleaner, faster, more documentation, more examples. Add support to play music notes, sound effects. Similar to the Commodore 128 BASIC play and sound commands. Support PVM file format (less RAM, less disk space). Design PCB / Shield for the Matrix Portal M4. Design 3D \u0026ldquo;enclosure\u0026rdquo; to attach to the speaker. Attach a battery. Create more games\u0026hellip; \u0026hellip;in sum, a real Nintendo Switch killer! :) ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2020/12/13/designing-a-modern-retro-console-for-my-kids-adding-chiptune-music/","summary":"\u003ch3 id=\"the-ideal-modern-retro-video-game-console\"\u003eThe ideal modern-retro video game console\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G\u003c/a\u003e_Fzt8RlbFc\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy goal is to build a video game console for (my) kids.

My original intention was to patch what was only needed and stop there. But I got carried away and I ended up analyzing and commenting the entire Commando code.\nThe commented code (that can be recompiled to generate the exact original binary) is here:\nhttps://gitlab.com/ricardoquesada/c64-commando-2084/tree/orig Findings - Level 2 Apparently, the original idea was to ship Commando with 4 levels instead of 3. There is a lot of code/data that indicates that a \u0026ldquo;level 2\u0026rdquo; (the levels that are shipped with Commando are level 0, 1 and 3) was in progress, or even finished.\nAll the actions, charset-mask, trigger rows are present. What\u0026rsquo;s missing is the map and a partial charset. The charset used for the main screen is likely the one designed for level 2.\nSpeculation from my part, \u0026ldquo;Level 2\u0026rdquo; was probably removed due to lack of time (?) or due lack of RAM to create a single-load game (?).\nFor more info about this level, search for \u0026ldquo;LVL2\u0026rdquo; in the main.asm.\nMap and actions Each level consist of 40x200 map. Each level consists of: Charset unique for the level: LVL0 at $C000, LVL1 at $C800, LVL3 at $D800 Each char in the charset contains a mask that indicates the background priority. See LVL0_CHARSET_MASK_TBL in main.asm. A map: LVL0 is at $6000, LVL1 at $8000, LVL3 at $A000 List of actions: each action represents a sprite that must be created. But an action can perform non-related sprite tasks as well, like opening a door. See LVL0_ACTION_TBL in main.asm. List of rows: when the master row index (see V_SCROLL_ROW_IDX) matches this number, the associated action is executed. See LVL0_TRIGGER_ROW_TBL in main.asm. Actions can receive an optional \u0026ldquo;sprite X position\u0026rdquo; argument. See LVL0_SPRITE_X_LO_TBL and LVL0_SPRITE_X_HI_TBL in main.asm Sprites The game supports up to 16 virtual sprites.\nSprite 0 is used for the hero Sprites 1-3 are used for hero\u0026rsquo;s bullets Sprite 4 is used for hero grenades Sprites 5-15 are used for enemies, including its bullets/grenades. Each sprite has:\nX and Y coordinates (including X LSB and X MSB) Sprite frame (which sprite to render). $FF is an empty frame. Sprite color Background priority (e.g: should it be rendered behind a tree?) Animation type (see below). If it is 0, it means it is an empty sprite. Extra variables that are used for different things. Varies from anim type to anim type. Some enemies, like the motorcycle, take two sprites.\nAnimation type An animation represents what the sprite should do during the game. For example, the animation type TYPE_ANIM_SOLDIER_BULLET, animates the bullet. See TYPE_ANIM_TBL in main.asm for the complete list of animation types.\nAn sprite can change its animation in runtime. For example, the TYPE_ANIM_SOLIDER_BEHIND_SMTH has certain logic. But when the hero is at the same Y position as it is, then it changes its animation to TYPE_ANIM_SOLDIER. Similar, the TYPE_ANIM_SOLDIER_JUMPING animates the \u0026ldquo;jumping\u0026rdquo; solider. But when the solider lands, it changes its animation to TYPE_ANIM_SOLDIER. Those are only two examples, but most animations change its animation type in runtime.\nAnimation type 0 When a sprite goes out of bounds, or an enemy dies, or an animation ends, that sprite is set with animation type 0, which is the TYPE_ANIM_SPAWN_SOLIDER.\nWhat this animation does, is to create random enemies. And when an enemy is created, it changes in animation type to something different than 0.\nThat means, that when there map is \u0026ldquo;full\u0026rdquo; of enemies (all animation types are different than 0), the TYPE_ANIM_SPAWN_SOLDIER is not called. And when there many empty sprites, it gets called more often.\nCollision detection Collision detection is done in software (no hardware collision detection is used).\nThere is a routine to check whether the hero is hit (see CHECK_COLLISION) and another for enemies (see TYPE_ANIM_HERO_BULLET, TYPE_ANIM_HERO_GRENADE_END).\nEach animation type has contains a mask (see f2544) that indicates whether it can collide with bullet, grenades, both or nothing. For example, when the soldier is in the trench, it can only be killed with a grenade.\nPersonal thoughts From a high-level (architecture) point of view, the code is very well designed. It is pretty easy to add new types of actions, or create new levels, or modify existing ones with little change in the code/data.\nFrom lower-level point of view, it seems that parts of the code could be improved (see FIXME in main.asm), specially regarding performance and flickers. Seeing many Level-2 traces, plus seeing certain bugs makes me think that the development team was under pressure to release the game ASAP (something fairly common in the gaming industry).\nAdditionally, it seems that the assembler used didn\u0026rsquo;t optimize the code to use zero page. For example, calls to:\nSTY $FB,Y are assembled to:\nSTY $00FB,Y ;3 byte variation, instead of the two-one.

I knew nothing about it when I got it, except that it was a similar to the Amiga.\nThe Atari ST, the Amiga and the Macintosh were computers released in the mid 80\u0026rsquo;s, all of them based on the Motorola 68k, and all of them came with a windows-based GUI. This was a revolutionary step compared to the 8-bit machines which were CLI text-driven.\nThe base \u0026ldquo;ST\u0026rdquo; model includes:\n8 Mhz Motorola 68000 CPU Yamaha YM2149 3-voice square-wave plus 1-voice white noise (mono) 512Kb or 1Mb RAM (520 vs 1040 models) 3 video modes: 320 x 200 x 16 colors (from a 512 color palette). 640 x 200 x 4 colors (from a 512 color palette) 640 x 400 x 2 colors (I believe this is only B/W) Midi In / Out: Apparently a killer feature for musicians. Compared with the 8-bit home computers like the C64/C128, the Atari ST is a good improvement. From only 64K/128K RAM to 512K (or 1024K) RAM, an 8 Mhz CPU (vs. 1 or 2 Mhz) and Midi. But there are no hardware sprites (no blitter), and the music is chiptune, like in the C64. The C64 SID chip might be even better. The video modes are OKish. Having a 320x200 @ 16 colors from a palette of 512 is nice, but not that impressive. It is worth noting that the Atari ST (like the Amiga and the Macintosh) don\u0026rsquo;t have \u0026ldquo;text video modes\u0026rdquo;, they only have \u0026ldquo;graphic\u0026rdquo; ones.\nThe ST line \u0026ldquo;Atari ST\u0026rdquo; is both the a line of computers (eg: like the \u0026ldquo;Amiga\u0026rdquo; line of computers), but also a model (eg: like Amiga 500). The Atari ST line includes the: ST, STF / STFM, STE, TTs and Falcon.\nST: Meaning Sixteen / Thirty-two, the 68000 external bus width / internals. Released in June 1985. STF: Like the ST, but with a F loppy drive built-in. Released in 1986. STFM: Like the STF, but with a RF M odulator built-in (useful to connect to a TV). Released in 1986. STE: The \u0026ldquo;E\u0026rdquo; for E nhanced: Better sound chip, a 4096 color palette, a blitter and perhaps something more. Released in 1989. Mega STE / TT: A business version of the STE. Released in 1991. TT means Thirty-two / Thirty-two. Falcon: Even better than the STE. Supposedly the Amiga killer. Released in 1992. Peculiarities Back in the day you needed two different monitors to view all supported video modes. But you couldn\u0026rsquo;t plug them at the same time. Either you have a monitor for the High-res mode (640x400 @ 2 colors), or another one for the Low-res (320x200 @ 16 colors) and Med-res (640x200 @ 4 colors). There wasn\u0026rsquo;t a monitor to support all 3 resolutions.\nNowadays, it is possible to have one monitor for all resolutions. You basically need:\nA multisync monitor, capable of supporting 15Hz, like the NEC Multisync LCD 1970VX. A special cable like the Best 2nd Gen. ST Multi Sync adapter cable . [caption id=\u0026quot;\u0026quot; align=\u0026ldquo;alignnone\u0026rdquo; width=\u0026ldquo;512\u0026rdquo;] Atari 1040 STF + Modulator, Multisync monitor and cable. Supports all 3 video modes.[/caption]\nThe other peculiarity is the location of the joystick / mouse ports. Imagine the worst possible place to put them\u0026hellip; well, you are not even close. They are placed under the machine. Apparently the basic ST model has them at the right, like in the Atari 800 and the C64. But, in the STF, in order to make space for the floppy drive and the power supply they redesigned the layout and place the joystick ports under the case.\nNice surprises When I get old stuff, in particular old computers, I\u0026rsquo;m interested in its history. Was it used for gaming, composing music, development\u0026hellip; or not used at all? Who used it? Was the machine upgraded? Using official kits, or 3rd party add-ons? When was the last time it was used? In which country / city was used? Does the diskettes (or hard drives) contain source code and/or binaries made by the original owner? Etc.\n[caption id=\u0026quot;\u0026quot; align=\u0026ldquo;alignnone\u0026rdquo; width=\u0026ldquo;512\u0026rdquo;] Atari 1040 STF with modulator, upgraded to 2.5Mb RAM and some with dual TOS + battery.[/caption]\nIn this case, I believe, the machine belonged to an amateur (or professional) musician + developer. The machine came with many programming books (C and assembly) and with software to compose music (including Steinberg\u0026rsquo;s Cubase). The machine was upgraded to 2.5Mb of RAM using a 3rd-party kit. A kind of dual TOS is installed (but only one TOS is being used) with a (dead) battery. And the modulator was installed as well.\nMaintenance Like any old machine, specially when it was left unused for 20+ years, I did some minimum maintenance:\nFloppy drive: was not working. Cleaning the header + adjust a lose wire/spring did the trick. Power supply: I recapped it. Keyboard: removed all keys + cleaning. Gaming I only tried a few Atari ST games, and so far, the one that I liked most is Super Sprint.\nYou can download a big collection of ST games from here:\nAtari ST TOSEC 2012_04_23 If you want to burn floppies from floppy images, pay attention to the image extension:\n\u0026ldquo;.st\u0026rdquo;: Ideal to burn floppy images. Mostly cracked / unprotected games. \u0026ldquo;.stx\u0026rdquo;: Original floppy image, including protected games. Not possible to burn floppies with these images. But emulators support them. And in order to burn ST floppy images you should use this tool: http://atari.8bitchip.info/floimgd.php\nAnd the emulator that I\u0026rsquo;m using is Hatari. Works on Mac, Linux and Windows.\nDemoscene The Atari ST has a active demoscene. Not the most active one, but not dead either. I would say somewhere in the middle between the C64 (the most active one?) and the IBM PCjr ( almost non-existent demoscene).\nI haven\u0026rsquo;t watched that many demos yet. So far, this is the one that I liked most. And it targets the 520 ST, the most limited of the Atari ST line:\nThe Atari-Forum has a subforum to discuss demos, and programming.\nhttp://www.atari-forum.com/viewforum.php?f=55 Development toolchains So, now that the computer is running, the important question is, what are the available developer tools. The machine was powerful enough to host native C / assembler compilers. But I\u0026rsquo;m mostly interested in cross-development. So far, this is what I found:\nVasm: A nice cross-assembler Vbcc: A C cross-compiler gcc: Gcc 8.2 or gcc 4.6.4 + needed binutils. No further introduction is needed. Most probably I\u0026rsquo;ll start using Vasm + Vbcc. Too early to say whether they are what I need.\nFinal thoughts Yes, go and get one Atari ST for this holidays!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2018/11/08/atari-st-first-impressions/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA few months ago I got an Atari 1040 STF.

It was presented at Flashparty 2018 and won the Demo category.\nRequirements An IBM PCjr with at least 64k RAM.\nDownload Source code: https://gitlab.com/ricardoquesada/pcjr-flashparty–2018 Binary: pvm-64ko.zip (does not run on emulators) Technical description The demo is divided in the boot loader and demo 3 parts\nBoot loader [caption id=\u0026quot;\u0026quot; align=\u0026ldquo;alignnone\u0026rdquo; width=\u0026ldquo;512\u0026rdquo;] Boot loader[/caption] The demo is intended to work with a 64K RAM (or more) PCjr. Booting from its own boot loader is needed to save precious memory. DOS alone takes ~20K of RAM. That is 30% of the total memory. You don’t want to waste that memory.\nThe boot loader is pretty simple:\nIt has a list of sectors-to-load for each part. Each part is loaded starting at 0050:0100 address (which is the same as 0060:0000) and after loading it, jumps to that address.\nInstalls ricarDOS, a mini “DOS” that hooks the 0x21 interrupt handler with:\nah == 0x4c:\nin ricarDOS it terminates current scene and loads the next one. in real DOS it terminates the current DOS program. ah == 0x09: prints a $-terminated string\nricarDOS was created to have a “rapid testing framework”. It allows to run each part on an emulator using real DOS, but when run from the boot loader, the actual DOS calls are trapped to ricarDOS.\nThe memory is organized like this:\nMemory map: 0 - 0x01ff: 512 bytes used for the vector table for the first 0x80 interrupts 0x0200 - 0x03ff: 512 bytes used for ricarDOS 0x0400 - 0x04ff: 256 bytes. BIOS variables 0x0500 - 0x05ff: 256 bytes. stack. used globally for all the demo parts 0x0600 - 0xffff: 64000 bytes free to be used for the demo (including video) Part I Big Fonts The big fonts are based on Andrew Glassner’s Notebook. Basically the rectangle to draw each font is divided in 55 segments. Think of the typical 8-segment display, but instead of 8, it has 55 segments. With 55 segments you can render pretty nice fonts. Specially if they are designed by Andrew Glassner.\n[caption id=\u0026quot;\u0026quot; align=\u0026ldquo;alignnone\u0026rdquo; width=\u0026ldquo;386\u0026rdquo;] 55 segments[/caption] So we created 110 (55 + 55) primitives:\n55 primitives to turn on each segment and 55 primitives to turn them off Each letter consists of a 64-bit bitset containing the 55 segments.\nThe bitset for letter A is:\n;ASCII: 0x41 table_a: dw 0b1110010011101110,0b1111111101000101,0b1000111111111111,0b0000000000000111 And this one is for letter B:\n;ASCII: 0x42 table_b: dw 0b1010010011101111,0b0111111011111100,0b1111110001111111,0b0000000001111011 Notice that A and B have many segments in common. If letter B should be drawn right after letter A, then only the “diff” between A and B needs to be drawn.\n[caption id=\u0026quot;\u0026quot; align=\u0026ldquo;alignnone\u0026rdquo; width=\u0026ldquo;512\u0026rdquo;] A xor B[/caption]\nAnd the diff between A and B is just a simple xor between A’s bitset and B’s bitset.\nA: 0b1110010011101110,0b1111111101000101,0b1000111111111111,0b0000000000000111 xor B: 0b1010010011101111,0b0111111011111100,0b1111110001111111,0b0000000001111011 —————————————————————————– 0b0100000000000000,0b1000000110111001,0b0111001110000000,0b0000000001111000 0 are skipped (it means that the segemnts are the same), while 1 are processed. The segment is turned on or off accordingly. For A xor B only 18 segments needs to be updated, instead of 55.\nAnd that’s it.\nMisc:\nAresluna editor was used to get the definition of each letter. We used a custom script to automatically generate all the 110 primitives and bitsets. Graphic Loading The Big Font uses the 320 x 200 @ 4 colors video mode. 16K RAM needed is needed for it. So, from the 64000 bytes reserved for the scene, 16k will be used for the video mode. That leaves 47616 bytes free for the code.\nAnd the code to render the big fonts takes ~47000 bytes, with only a few hundred bytes free.\nIn order to add an additional 16K graphics, the new graphic was appended after the Big Font code (with some padding).\npart1.com format +--------------+ 0x00600 | | | Big Font | | code + data | | | | | | | V | | | | end of | | Big Font | |~~~~~~~~~~~~~~| | padding... | ~0x0bf00 |~~~~~~~~~~~~~~| | | 0x0c000 | graphics | | data | | (16K RAM) | | | 0x0ffff +--------------+ So when the part1.com file is loaded, the graphic will be loaded right where the video card expects it. And it will be displayed automatically.\nPart II [caption id=\u0026quot;\u0026quot; align=\u0026ldquo;alignnone\u0026rdquo; width=\u0026ldquo;512\u0026rdquo;] Part II: Using 320x200 @ 16[/caption] From a technical point of view, nothing interesting really happens in Part II. It is just a simple horizontal scroll that consumes almost all the CPU cycles.\n[Note: Additional effects were planned for this part, but we didn’t have the time]\nIt uses a 320x200 @ 16 colors video mode. In order to enable this video mode in a 64k-only PCjr you have to do:\nsub ax,ax mov ds,ax ;ds = 0 mov word [0x0415],128 ;make BIOS set_video_modo believe that we ; have at least 128K RAM, otherwise it won\u0026#39;t let ; us set video mode 9 Bug: the graphic won’t look that good on 64k-only PCjr. We tested this idea about 2 months before the deadline with a random graphic, and it looked Ok. So we though it was possible to use 32k video modes on the 64k-only PCjr. But one day before the release we noticed that the graphic didn’t look that good. And unfortunately we couldn’t fix it yet. Not sure whether this is a hardware limitation (it shouldn’t be, in theory), or not. We’ll try to fix this soon.\nPart III [Note: Originally, we wanted to add some 3d effects in Part III. But after doing some performance tests with basic 2D polygons, we decided it was not worth it. The PCjr was too slow for what we wanted to do. We reused part of that code for the Vector Fonts.]\nVector fonts By vector font we mean a letter that is defined by one or more polygons. I’m using a primitive to draw a line called Line08_Draw ( code based on Richard Wilton book).\nOn top of that we implemented a draw_poly function. And each letter is defined by a list of polygons.\nThe benefits of vector fonts, it is to scale them up/down \u0026amp; rotate them for free, without losing precision.\nThe fonts are defined using polar coordinates ( radius + angle); not the more common cartesian coordinates ( x + y). This is legacy code from my 2d-polygon experiment. Using polar coordinates + lookup table is a nice and fast way to rotate polygons. But in retrospective, kind of overkill for Part III.\nRender buffer Mode 160x100 @ 16 colors ( Trixter’s variation) is being used for the vector font part. And the bottom 40 rows are reserved for the fonts. That’s a total of 3200 bytes (160*40/2). We are using an additional 3200-bytes buffer (a render buffer) where the text is pre-rendered. Then the render buffer is copied row by row, one at the time, to the video buffer. The video buffer is scrolled up or down (depending on the effect). And that is basically it.\nEaster Egg [caption id=\u0026quot;\u0026quot; align=\u0026ldquo;alignnone\u0026rdquo; width=\u0026ldquo;512\u0026rdquo;] Easter Egg[/caption] The final part is pure PCjr BIOS code.\nPopulate the keyboard buffer with “PVM RULEZ!” Put sprite data in the correct place Initialize some video variables …and jump to the correct place in BIOS. The sprite data needs to be placed at 0060:0000, the same space used for the demo, so extra careful was needed to not overwrite our own init_easter_egg routine.\nMisc All the “official” PCjr video modes were used in this demo, without any repetition.\nBoot loader: 40x25, 80x25 (when PCjr is not detected) Part I: 160x200 @ 16, 320x200 @ 4 Part II: 320x200 @ 16 Part III: 160x100 @ 16, 640x200 @ 4, 640x200 @ 2 Embarrassing bug The demo is all about the 64k-RAM PCjr. The embarrassing part is that some graphics don’t look Ok with the 64k-RAM PCjr. The high-density video mode (80x25 text, 320x200 @ 16 colors and 640x200 @ 4 colors) are disabled in the 64K-RAM PCjr for a good reason: the PCjr can’t display them, at least, in theory.\nTwo months before the deadline, we did a test on a 64k-RAM PCjr, and the 320x200 @ 16 colors video mode looked correct… only because we tested with a single color graphic. We painted the screen with one color, and it looked fine.\nBut one day before the deadline, while we were testing a release-candidate on the 64k-RAM PCjr, we noticed that some graphics weren’t looking Ok. We panicked. We couldn’t believe what were seeing. We tried to understand what was happening, but we failed and couldn’t fix the bug.\n[caption id=\u0026quot;\u0026quot; align=\u0026ldquo;alignnone\u0026rdquo; width=\u0026ldquo;512\u0026rdquo;] Looks OKish from far away\u0026hellip;[/caption]\nSo we shipped the demo with this embarrassing bug. A few days after the party, and after discussing it in the PCjr forum, we realized that the 64k-RAM PCjr has the following limitations:\nThe system board 64K RAM is mapped at the bottom of the 1Mb address space. The system board 64Kb RAM is mapped to the next 64K bytes of address space if the the 64Kb Memory and Display Expansion option is not installed.\nWhen inserted, the memory expansion option uses the ODD memory space, while the system memory space is decoded as the EVEN memory. Thus, when used as video memory, the memory expansion option has the video attributes while the on-board system memory has the video characters. This arrangement provides a higher bandwidth of video characters.\nIn addition to the eight memory modules, the expansion card has logic to do EVEN/ODD address decoding, video data multiplexing and Card Present wrap.\nAnd that explains why the 640x200@4 graphic looked as a monochrome bitmap and the 320x200@16 looked jagged. It is related how these 2 video modes are represented.

But that brings other issues. We still don’t know whether or not it is feasible to display a high-density graphic in the 64K-RAM PCjr. Although everything seems to indicate that it is not feasible.\nThe not-so-bad news is that the 128K-RAM PCjr (the most popular model), is as slow as the 64k-RAM version but runs the demo correctly. No glitches in the graphics.In fact, if we had targeted the 128k-RAM version, probably we could have fit everything in a single executable + our boot loader.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2018/09/26/64k-ram-ought-to-be-enough-a-demo-for-the-pcjr/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eUpdated 2018–10–08\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uakDpJns9LA\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uakDpJns9LA\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA demo for the IBM PCjr by \u003ca href=\"http://pungas.space\"\u003ePungas de Villa Martelli\u003c/a\u003e.

Or how fast is a nop compared to a cwd ?\nI created a test ( perf.asm) that measures the performance of different opcodes and run it on different Intel 8088 machines. I run the test multiple times just to make sure the results were stable enough. All interrupts were disabled, except the Timer (of course). And on the PCjr the NMI is disabled as well.\nWithout further ado, here are the results:\nIntel 8088 opcodes performance And these are my conclusions:\nAs expected, 1-byte size + 3-cycles opcodes are the fastest: nop, xchg ax,xx, inc ax (note that nop is literally a xchg ax,ax) 2-byte + 2-cycle opcodes (like mov al,al) are twice as slow as the 1-byte + 3-cycle opcodes. CPU intensive instructions like mul and div perform exactly the same in all machines. Cycle-eaters don\u0026rsquo;t affect them that much (kind of expected). In theory, the 7.16Mhz Tandy 1000 HX should be 50% faster than the 4.77Mhz mode. And that\u0026rsquo;s true for CPU-intensive opcodes like mul and div. But opcodes that are \u0026ldquo;cycle-eaters\u0026rdquo;-bound the performance gain is 0% in most of them. IBM PCjr vs. IBM PCjr: The PCjr could be by far the slowest of the 4.77Mhz machines, or the fastest: When running code in the first 128 Kb RAM the performance is terrible! A simple mov al,al is 2.6 times slower! This is due to additional wait-states. On the other hand, when running code above the 128 Kb RAM, it is the fastest (albeit by a tiny bit). One of my IBM PCjr is a tiny bit faster than the other one. Couldn\u0026rsquo;t find out why. The CPU is the same, same clock speed. Something in the bus (?) perhaps ? It is faster enough to break some cycle-dependent code. From fastest to slowest: IBM PCjr (code running above 128 Kb RAM) IBM PC 5150 (tiny bit slower) Tandy 1000 (tiny bit slower) Tandy 1000 HX 4.77Mhz-mode (tiny bit slower) IBM PCjr (code running below 128 Kb RAM) (slower by a huge margin) One opcode that is worth-noting is cwd:\nIt is a 1-byte size, 5 cycles opcode It is a tiny bit slower than a nop The negative side is that it destroys ax and dx What I like about it, is that it is between 7%~17% slower than a nop (depending on the machine). And when doing timing dependent code, sometimes you need an opcode that is just a tiny bit faster or slower than another one. In my case, I was able to have a stable raster bar on the Tandy 1000 thanks to it (more on this on a future post).\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2018/03/04/performance-of-the-8088-on-pc-pcjr-and-tandy-1000/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Qm6Ynexbr8lJUggbCcZoKQaPX-qKyrA5Ef4_Feu7mju1M6vVhiN86NjNpmXBZlO_AdAu0KWVWACqK_oWMEPGkgeSSwOBsSV804i3WS0dFML6LqpMY7o3dwlV6oBs0dSJfjM1D5vnjYQ=-no\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s well-known that you should \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/jagregory/abrash-zen-of-asm/blob/master/src/chapter-04.md\"\u003emeasure the performance of your code\u003c/a\u003e, and not rely only on the opcode\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;cycle counts\u0026rdquo;.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut how fast is an IBM PC 5150 compared to a PCjr ? or to a Tandy 1000? or how fast is the Tandy 1000 HX in fast mode (7.16Mhz) compared to the slow mode (4.77Mhz) ?

This diagnostics code has undocumented features to perform the manufacturing and service tests:\nManufacturing burn-in mode: All 4 buttons pressed Manufacturing system-test mode: All 4 buttons pressed except Joystick 1 button A Service loop-post mode: All buttons pressed except Joystick 1 button B Service system-test mode: All buttons pressed except Joystick 2 button A When entering in \u0026ldquo;Manufacturing system-test mode\u0026rdquo;, all internal tests (diskette, video, joystick, sound, printer, modem) will be performed without user interaction. The first test, and without any warning, is the diskette test that will destroy the diskette data. Since there is no visual indication of what\u0026rsquo;s happening, port 0x10 will have the test number that is being executed.\nWhy IBM did this:\nRetro Moe strongly believes that IBM left the code undocumented on purpose to prevent people from performing their own in-depth diagnostics.

We later renamed it Cocos2d. The idea was to create a game engine for the games we were creating for PyWeek.\n[caption id=\u0026quot;\u0026quot; align=\u0026ldquo;alignnone\u0026rdquo; width=\u0026ldquo;512\u0026rdquo;] PyCamp 2008. Centro Allen Gardiner, Los Cocos, Córdoba, Argentina[/caption]\nWe started the game engine with Lucio Torre, Daniel Moisset, Rayentray Tappa, and I, with the help of Alejandro Cura and other members of PyAr.\nWe announced a beta (or was it alpha?) version in a lightning talk at PyCon Chicago in March 2008.\nIn July 2008, Lucio and I went to Euro Python to present Cocos2d (was it v0.3?).\n[caption id=\u0026quot;\u0026quot; align=\u0026ldquo;alignnone\u0026rdquo; width=\u0026ldquo;512\u0026rdquo;] With Lucio Torre at Euro Python 2008 presenting Cocos2d. Vilnius, Lithuania, July 2008[/caption]\nIn addition, Lucio and I presented Cocos2d at PyCon Ar 2008 and 2009.\nIn 2010 Claudio Canepa became the new Cocos2d developer/maintainer.\nCocos2d-iPhone Somewhere around the beginning of 2008, Apple announced that the iPhone would have a store. Apple would only take 30% of the revenue (back then, carriers were taking around 90%). Furthermore, the iPhone was powered by OpenGL ES and the OS was UNIX based.\nAlso, around that time, I wanted to create commercial games. I had previously considered the Web (Flash) and feature phones (J2ME) as possible markets. But after Apple\u0026rsquo;s announcement, I decided to develop games exclusively for iPhone.\nI needed a game engine for my iPhone games, so I re-wrote Cocos2d in Objective-C. The high level design remained the same, but I had to make substantial changes to make it work on the iPhone\u0026hellip; and that is how \u0026ldquo;cocos2d-iphone\u0026rdquo; was born. The first cocos2d-iphone version (v0.1) was released in June 2008.\nIn March 2008, I applied to get my iPhone Developers license, and finally got it in July 2008 (it took me 4 months to get one, whereas today you can get one in a few minutes). It was not possible to publish games on the iPhone App without a license. While waiting for my license, I did some contract work, developing some games for 3rd parties using cocos2d-iphone.\nHaving gotten my iPhone Developers license, I created my first (and only) game for the iPhone: Sapus Tongue. However, I realized that creating commercial games was not that fun for me; neither did I find it easy. Since cocos2d-iphone was already popular, I decided to work full time on it. The reason I could do this is that I was actually making a living by selling two commercial tools for cocos2d-iphone: LevelSVG: a sort of editor + physics on top of cocos2d, and Sapus Tongue source code.\nAt the beginning of 2009 there were already more than 100 games using cocos2d-iphone. The first one to reach #1 at the iPhone App Store was Stick Wars.\nAfter that, many other cocos2d-iphone games reached #1. And most of the time, there was at least one cocos2d-iphone game in the Top #10. I believe this was the case from 2009 until the end of 2011.\nNot only games were created with cocos2d-iphone, but also animated books, photo applications, and more. Some cocos2d-iphone games and applications were featured at WWDC 2010. Even games that Apple proudly announced as \u0026ldquo;built using Apple libraries\u0026rdquo;, were actually built with cocos2d-iphone.\nMany cocos2d-iphone forks/ports/bindings were created as well, such as:\nAt least two Java ports: cocos2d-android and cocos2d-android-1 A C++ port: Cocos2d-x Two JavaScript ports: Cocos2d-HTML5 and Cocos2d-JavaScript Three C# ports: CocosNet, Cocos2d-XNA, CocosSharp A Go port: Gocos2d Python bindings (bindings for cocos2d-iphone and for cocos2d-x) and Python port (a new port based on cocos2d-iphone, and not on the original Cocos2d) Ruby bindings: ShinyCocos and support for RubyMotion In July 2011, after working on cocos2d-iphone for more than 3 years, and with the help of the community, I released cocos2d-iphone v1.0. Some stats: ~140 contributors, ~2600 commits and 63 internal releases.\nThe community was very healthy, with many people helping each other, opening bug reports, sending pull requests, suggesting features, etc. The ecosystem around cocos2d-iphone was also very healthy: many cocos2d-iphone books were published, and many editors/tools (both commercial and free/open source) supported cocos2d-iphone, many job positions were looking for cocos2d-iphone developers.\nIn May 2011, I joined Zynga. At Zynga we used cocos2d-iphone for some iOS games. To port them to Android, some of them were rewritten using AndEngine, and others were ported using AppPortable\u0026rsquo;s Objective-C/UIKit stack.\nIn 2012, Android was already very strong. I wanted to support Android natively (and other platforms as well). I had three options:\nStop working on cocos2d-iphone, and work on Cocos2d-x (the C++ fork) Keep developing cocos2d-iphone, and use 3rd party commercial Objective-C stack (like StellaSDK, NoodleCake or AppPortable) to port cocos2d-iphone to Android Keep developing cocos2d-iphone, and develop an open source Objective-C stack to port cocos2d-iphone to Android. I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to depend on 3rd party commercial tools, and I didn\u0026rsquo;t have the time to write my own Objective-C stack, and Cococs2d-x was already popular. So I decided to help the Cocos2d-x team. We started using Cocos2d-x at Zynga as well.\nAt Zynga, with the help of the Cocos2d-x team, we created a very attractive tooling:\nCocos2d-x and cocos2d-iphone were feature compatible. The API was almost the same (of course, one in C++ and one in Objective-C) CocosBuilder (created by Viktor Lidholt) included many good features: Scene editor, key-frame animation editor, JavaScript scripting and more. Scenes exported by CocosBuilder were supported both by cocos2d-iphone and Cocos2d-x. The only drawback was that keeping feature-compatibility between Cocos2d-x and cocos2d-iphone was expensive: we had to write the features twice. And also CocosBuilder was built on top of cocos2d-iphone which meant it was only available for Mac (no Windows version), and also required writing the features twice. Supporting Windows was important for many Cocos2d-x users.\nI kept developing cocos2d-iphone until June 2013, and then I passed the torch to Lars Birkemose (who in 2016 passed it again to Andrei Volodin). In August 2013 I joined Chukong.\nCocos2d-x Note: Chukong, the company behind Cocos2d-x and Cocos Studio, is a Chinese company with its headquarters in Beijing. Cocos Studio was developed at Beijing. Cocos2d-x is being developed in Xiamen (south of China), and I joined their California office were we did a bit of everything.\nCocos2d-x was started by Zhe Wang in July 2010. It was a clone of cocos2d-iphone, but coded in C++ instead of Objective-C. His goal was to create an SDK to facilitate porting cocos2d-iphone games to the uPhone (a phone project that was later cancelled). In order to facilitate the porting, Cocos2d-x included all the Objective-C patterns that were found in cocos2d-iphone. Somewhere in 2012 (or was it 2011?) the Cocos2d-x team joined Chukong.\nChukong had the resources, the willing, and the position to make Cocos2d-x a world class game engine / tooling. Cocos2d-x, back in 2013, had about between 70%~80% of the Chinese market share.\nAt Chukong, we started by designing Cocos2d-x v3, which included the removal of Objective-C patterns from its code, the use of modern C++ APIs, the update of the renderer (Nite), the addition of 3d features (Tony and Harrison) and the writing of a Programmers Guide (Jason).\nBut the most important thing was the editor: We needed one. Chukong had invested a lot of resources in Cocos Studio. It had many features, but its UX wasn\u0026rsquo;t appealing for the US/Western market, and it was Windows only.\nSo, in the US office, we (Justin, Nite and Kai) started working from scratch on an editor for Cocos2d-x both for the Chinese and US/Western markets (something similar to CocosBuilder, but built on top of Cocos2d-x and compatible with Windows and Mac. Qt was used for this).\nUnfortunately the new editor was cancelled. As hard as we tried to improve Cocos Studio\u0026rsquo;s UX, it failed to attract the US/Western market.\nOther projects were cancelled as well, such as Cocos2d-HTML5 v4, Cocos2d-x v4 renderer + HAL, Cocos2d-x launcher, Cocos IDE. Even Cocos Studio got cancelled.\nCancelling projects, specially when they are almost ready, can be frustrating. But our main challenge was finding a good business model. We tried different things, but we couldn\u0026rsquo;t find a good one.\nIn hindsight, this is what I think we should have done:\nWork on just one editor: the Qt editor that was supposed to be the Cocos Studio replacement. Offer services within the editor: SDKBOX, and other services. Focus: Only work on casual/mid-core features (no VR or other distracting features). Try to be the best ones in that category. After working 9 years on Cocos2d, and due to the development of recent events, the time has come for me to work on something else. What should I do next? Some people say that the future is IoT, others say it is Machine Learning, while the rest say it is VR/AR. They are all wrong: The future is the Commodore 64. See you soon.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2017/04/16/cocos2d-in-a-glimpse/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"cocos2d-python\"\u003eCocos2d (Python)\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ZXpO9qBoRfmnSsiDZYWjM_SqUhyzJQe6NT3mFDIyo1qeIZbHncgH9SA-RC-TuL8cT92zqP0kTb1JXcb4BLMg3ir_5IssEqEILVxf5xHTCGiBtzpyUaRBVyPcTHDmZJj-hPkxh8w=-no\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn February 2008, at Los Cocos, Córdoba, Argentina, we started the \u0026ldquo;Los Cocos\u0026rdquo; Python game engine.

How handy!\nBuilding the Commodore Home The UniJoystiCle WiFi device Commodore Home uses the UniJoystiCle technology to communicate with the C64. It is a device that allows you to control the two joysticks from your smartphone.\nThe instructions to build and setup one are here: DOCUMENTATION.md. ( Ping me if you want an already built+assembled+tested unit. I sell them for $40+shipping).\nThe alarm system It consists of a magnetic sensor + WiFi device. When the sensor is open, the WiFi device will send the \u0026ldquo;trigger alarm\u0026rdquo; command to the C64.\nBill of Materials:\nWemos D1 Mini v2 ($4.00)\nWemos Proto Shield for D1 Mini ($0.99)\nWemos Battery Shield for D1 Mini ($2.50)\nWarning: it comes with an XH2.54 connector. You might need an adaptor Warning: check the polarity! Magnetic Sensor ($1.89)\nv3.7 LiPo Battery\nConnect \u0026ldquo;A0\u0026rdquo; (analog input) to the NC (Normally Closed) magnetic pin. And connect \u0026ldquo;v3.3\u0026rdquo; to the Com magnetic pin.\nAnd then upload the firmware to the device:\nDownload Platform.io Install the CH340 USB-to-serial driver Clone the Commodore Home project: https://github.com/ricardoquesada/c64-home.git And build and upload: $ cd alarm_firmware $ make upload (pre-compiled firmware coming soon. done: see below).\nThe Alarm WiFi will boot in Access Point mode. Connect to its WiFi network (it is called \u0026ldquo;commodore home alarm\u0026rdquo;) and open this URL:\nhttp://commodore_home_alarm.local/ Then configure the network parameters:\nPut it in Station mode Put the correct SSID and password Put the UniJoystiCle IP address \u0026hellip;and done. The alarm system is ready to go!\nThe Commodore 64 application The latest binary version can be downloaded from here:\nc_home_exo.prg The source code is here: https://github.com/ricardoquesada/c64-home\nIf you don\u0026rsquo;t have a UniJoystiCle WiFi device, it can be controlled with the keyboard. Just DO NOT use it with a joystick in port #2.\nIf there is an error with the printer (like printer not connected), it will change the border color.\nThe Smartphone application The Android application can be download from Google Play:\nThe Source code is here: https://github.com/ricardoquesada/unijoysticle\nThe iOS and Desktop UniJoystiCle applications don\u0026rsquo;t have the \u0026ldquo;Commodore Home\u0026rdquo; plugin yet (coming soon. done: see below).\nConnecting the printer Just connect the printer as device \u0026ldquo;4\u0026rdquo; (not \u0026ldquo;5\u0026rdquo;). Insert a piece of paper (doesn\u0026rsquo;t work without one), and connect the gears to the printer header.\nIt was tested with the MPS 803 printer and it works Ok. But it doesn\u0026rsquo;t work with the Okimate 10 printer since it places the printer header back to the left after each command. So, use the MPS 803.\nVideos Things that I did for the Retrochallenge C64 application (Assembly). Mostly a copy \u0026amp; paste from projects that I worked on before:\nReused the music player from chipdisk Reused menu system from The Uni Games Reused \u0026ldquo;UniJoystiCle Compatible\u0026rdquo; intro screen from The Uni Games I knew how to move the printer header using the BASIC \u0026ldquo;print#\u0026rdquo; command. But I had to do some research to move it using assembly. Used VChar64 to design the screens/fonts. I didn\u0026rsquo;t compose the songs. I grabbed them from HVSC. Android application(Java)\nWrote the \u0026ldquo;Commodore Home\u0026rdquo; UniJoystiCle plugin. It replaced the old \u0026ldquo;Linear mode\u0026rdquo; plugin. Firmware for the Alarm system (C):\nIt was mostly a copy \u0026amp; paste from the UniJoystiCle firmware that I did before. Alarm design:\nQuick and dirty design: using the A0 (analog pin) from the ESP8266. UniJoystiCle Desktop application (C++):\nI was able to have a working prototype using the \u0026ldquo;linear mode\u0026rdquo; but in the end I haven\u0026rsquo;t used it. I\u0026rsquo;ll continue working on it later. It will be useful for UniJoystiCle users. UniJoystiCle PCB v0.4.1 (Eagle):\nDesigned v0.4.1 during the Retro Challenge, but I received the PCBs only two days before the deadline. So, for Commodore Home I used the previous version (v0.4.0). Pulley / Gear system:\nI was able to move the dimmer knot with pulleys+gears. Only by moving the gears manually. I didn\u0026rsquo;t have the time to attach the toothed bar to the printer header. Postmortem This was my first participation in the Retro Challenge competition. Overall, I\u0026rsquo;m happy with the outcome: I was able to finish most of the stuff that I wanted to do, but I\u0026rsquo;m exhausted. A few things to improve:\nDecide what to do from day 1. I started building the C64 I.D.IoT.R project, but ended doing the Commodore Home, a more challenging project. I built the \u0026ldquo;desktop client\u0026rdquo; for the C64 I.Di.IoT.R (took me like a week) and in the end I didn\u0026rsquo;t use it. Manage my time better. Don\u0026rsquo;t work until late. I wake up at 6:00 / 7:00am no matter what. Things that I would like to do in the near future:\nUniJoystiCle iOS client: Add Commodore Home plugin (done: see below) UniJoystiCle Desktop client: finish it and add Commodore Home plugin (done: see below) iOS/Android/Desktop client: Add voice support for the smartphone. You should be able to control the C64 by saying \u0026ldquo;Hey Commodore, activate the alarm\u0026rdquo;. C64 app: Add sound support for NTSC/PAL-N. Right now it only sounds Ok on PAL-B.

Not a major issue, but not ideal specially if you use your phone both for the UniJoystiCle and for \u0026ldquo;regular\u0026rdquo; stuff.\nTo solve that issue, I added WiFi Station mode support (Access Point mode is still supported). Basically the UniJoystiCle WiFi device, when in Station mode, can connect to any WiFi network. It also supports WPS (an auto-auth way to connect to a network). If Station mode fails, it will default to Access Point mode.\nIn order to switch to Station mode you have to:\nInstall firmware v0.4.3 (see below for more info) Boot the UniJoystiCle WiFi device (it will boot in Access Point mode) Connect to the unijoysticle-xxyyzz WiFi Network Open the web page: http://unijoysticle.local Select \u0026ldquo;Station\u0026rdquo; mode, put the credential (SSID and password) and reboot! From http://unijoysticle.local you can also configure the \u0026ldquo;Inactivity timeout\u0026rdquo;: how many seconds without activity should elapse before all the joystick lines are set to Low (simulates no joystick movements).\nI also added statistics: It tells you how many seconds you spent on the different joystick positions, and how many movements you did. Useful, right? :)\nInstalling a new firmware Another thing that needed to be improved was flashing a new firmware. Before v0.4.3, you had to do compile the firmware yourself, and upload it. Not ideal, specially if you are not a developer.\nSince then, manually flashing the firmware was simplified a bit:\nInstall the CP2104 USB-to-Serial drivers Download the latest firmware from here Install esptool \u0026amp; flash the new firmware: $ pip install esptool # Mac $ esptool.py --port /dev/cu.SLAB_USBtoUART write_flash -fm dio -fs 32m 0x00000 /path/to/unijoysticle_firmware.bin # Linux $ esptool.py --port /dev/ttyUSB0 write_flash -fm dio -fs 32m 0x00000 /path/to/unijoysticle_firmware.bin # Windows (I haven\u0026#39;t tried it. I don\u0026#39;t know what is the serial port there) For Windows, esptool.py should work as well, but NodeMCU-Flasher seems easier to use.\nAnd once you have v0.4.3 installed, you no longer need to manually flash new updates. Upgrades can be done from the WiFi device itself:\nMake sure that the WiFi device is in Station mode (needs internet connectivity) Open this URL, and follow the instructions: http://unijoysticle.local/upgrade Powering the WiFi Device Powering the device with a USB cable works. In fact, that is what I do with my devel WiFi board. But if you are not a developer powering the device from the Datasette port is a better alternative: self-powered, looks better.\nAn inexpensive (less than $3) DIY cable can be done with:\n1 x Molex 172879-0206 ($0.49) 2 x Molex 172160-1803 ($0.10 ea) 1 x Barrel Power Cable CA-2185 ($2.10) The benefits of this cable are:\nSoldering is not required It fits in the C128D The drawback, is that it is not a pass-through cable: You cannot use the datasette while using this cable. But hey, it costs less than $3.\nAnother thing is that the WiFi device needs less current than initially thought: 320mA instead of 400mA (this is the max needed current). In fact, on regular usage (no more than 5 High lines at the same time, and connected to a N WiFi network), it doesn\u0026rsquo;t need more than 150mA.\niOS \u0026amp; Android clients I noticed some bugs with the UniJoystiCle mode (both on iOS and Android) and added support for multicast DNS on Android (already built-in on iOS). The WiFi device advertises itself as unijoysticle.local. That means that you can use \u0026ldquo;unijoysticle.local\u0026rdquo; as the WiFi device address, and this will work both on Station and Access Point modes.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2016/09/27/unijoysticle-update-2/","summary":"\u003ch3 id=\"tldr\"\u003eTL;DR\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eStation Mode (with or without WPS)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eInactivity timeout  \u0026amp; Joystick statistics\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAuto-firmware upgrade\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eBetter ways to power the WiFi device\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"station-mode-and-other-features\"\u003eStation mode and other features\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/0IWKb6TdvqIj-p_fx7QMHMIiL7Zt-AuS_-vOG0K9o_J2ievuhhanZz7u3fnAkPSwNHbvCJD-K_M94w=w1047-h1320-no\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne thing that bothered me was that I needed to switch WiFi networks every time that I wanted to use the UniJoystiCle.

I got my first computer, a Commodore 64. I started learning BASIC and during \u0026lsquo;87 and \u0026lsquo;88 I created some very simple games. Somewhere in \u0026lsquo;88 I started learning assembly language ( machine language to be precise), but I don\u0026rsquo;t recall coding any game using this language. If so, it must have probably been due to the fact that I lacked a good monitor.\nSomewhere in 1989, I switched to the Commodore 128. Whereas I continued creating games using BASIC, I also started coding some games in assembly language, profiting from the built-in C128 monitor, which was pretty decent.\nIn 1990 I started coding intros, doing some trainers, and re-cracking some games for a local computer shop (SADOI). And I kept doing that until 1992.\nI stored all that sacred info (my games, intros, re-cracks, trainers) in my diskettes. At the time, my diskettes were my most valuable possession.\nWhen I switched to the PC (~1993), I packed all my Commodore stuff (diskettes, magazines and books) and put them in an empty large chest in my parents\u0026rsquo; apartment (with whom I was then living).\nYears later (somewhere around 2000???), I opened that chest and it was empty. It was not unusual for my parents to throw away things without any warning. So I assumed that my all Commodore stuff had been lost forever.\nFor the sake of putting this \u0026ldquo;tragedy\u0026rdquo; into perspective, my first programs were always special for me\u0026hellip; because they were the first ones. Hence, losing my Commodore diskettes was a big deal for me.\nMany years later, in 2014, I started coding for the Commodore 64 again, and started wondering about the fate of my diskettes. I secretly hoped there might be a possibility to find them, perhaps in one of the many apartments to which my parents and I had moved in the meantime.\nSomewhere in 2015, I brought up again to my wife the subject of the fate of my diskettes. She then suggested that they could be in my mother\u0026rsquo;s basement. \u0026ldquo;Unlikely\u0026rdquo;, I thought, though I had nothing to lose. However, there was a small detail: I live abroad. So, the tour to my mother\u0026rsquo;s basement, in Argentina, would have to wait.\nIn May 2016 I visited Argentina. Upon my arrival, I rushed to my mother\u0026rsquo;s basement. My sister came along and we had a blast. Amid used car tires (?), my black \u0026amp; white TV (a true antique), my PC diskettes, my sister\u0026rsquo;s college notebooks, there they were\u0026hellip;. MY COMMODORE DISKETTES!!!! What is more, all my Commodore magazines and books were there too! To my surprise they had been packed pretty well.\nSo, the preservation task started. The next day, I borrowed from Alakran a 1571 disk drive and started backing up all the diskettes with the ZoomFloppy cable. First, I tried with some non-important diskettes, and once I confirmed that the disk drive was working fine, I backed up the \u0026ldquo;my games\u0026rdquo; diskette (diskette #63!), the most important one! There are not enough words to describe the moment when I played all my games on the VICE emulator\u0026hellip;\n[caption id=\u0026quot;\u0026quot; align=\u0026ldquo;alignnone\u0026rdquo; width=\u0026ldquo;222\u0026rdquo;] Me, after preserving my Commodore games[/caption]\nSome data:\nI found 157 diskettes. Many diskettes had issues with track number one, the outer track. Unfortunately, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t recover the Nashua diskettes. All of them, 33 in total, had some kind of mold in the magnetic disk (Shame on you Nashua!). Some diskettes were not possible to recover for other reasons. But I was able to recover most, if not all, of my games, intros, trainers and re-cracks. Although I recovered a lot of stuff, only a few things are worth sharing. For example, my early Commodore 64 games are only interesting to me\u0026hellip; calling them games is a big overstatement. :) However, some of my Commodore 128 games are somewhat decent, namely:\nThe Race: the_race.d71\nSex Games III: sex_games_iii.d71\nTeenage Mutant Runner Turtle: tmrt.d71\nChardef v2.32.d71, a char editor (the grand daddy of VChar64). READ THE INSTRUCTIONS first.

I got my first computer, a Commodore 64. I started learning BASIC and during \u0026lsquo;87 and \u0026lsquo;88 I created some very simple games. Somewhere in \u0026lsquo;88 I started learning assembly language ( \u003ca href=\"http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/M/machine_language.html\"\u003emachine language\u003c/a\u003e to be precise), but I don\u0026rsquo;t recall coding any game using this language. If so, it must have probably been due to the fact that I lacked a good \u003ca href=\"https://www.c64-wiki.com/index.php/Machine_Code_Monitor\"\u003emonitor\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomewhere in 1989,  I switched to the Commodore 128. Whereas I continued creating games using BASIC, I also started coding some games in assembly language, profiting from the built-in C128 monitor, which was pretty decent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 1990 I started coding intros, doing some trainers, and re-cracking some games for a local computer shop (SADOI). And I kept doing that until 1992.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stored all that sacred info (my games, intros, re-cracks, trainers) in my diskettes.

I doesn\u0026rsquo;t need to be very powerful, just powerful enough to handle some UDP connections and configuring some GPIOs. Flash-able firmware: If possible with support for Arduino IDE (or similar). C++ preferred. Micropython could be a nice backup plan. WiFi Some GPIOs Which module to choose There many alternatives, and these are the ones that I evaluated:\nArduino + WiFi shield or ESP8266: This is the first option that I evaluated thanks to different suggestions. But since the ESP8266 already comes with a flash-able firmware, there was no need to use the Arduino part. I discarded this option, but I liked the ESP8266 part.\nAdafruit Huzzah breakout ($9.95) / Adafruit Feather Huzzah ($15.95): An ESP8266 based module. I like Adafruit products since they are very well tested, they give you support, have very good documentation. But they are usually on the pricy side. All ESP8266 boards are supported by the Arduino IDE which is a very good thing. (I ordered one Feather Huzzah).\nSparkFun ESP8266 Thing ($15.95): Similar to the Feather Huzzah.\nNodeMCU (~$4.00): Very similar too Adafruit Huzzah and SparkFun ESP8266 Thing. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure who built the first module (Adafruit, SparkFun or NodeMCU), although I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be surprised if NodeMCU was the first one. There is a lot of innovation in China in this area. NodeMCU comes with a firmware that supports Lua, which is nice for faster development. You should know that the Lua firmware could be installed in the other modules as well, and you can run C++ firmwares on NodeMCU as well. There are three different NodeMCU brands:\nAmica: Which seems to be the official one, although I didn\u0026rsquo;t know this when I decided to buy the LoLin. LoLin: It seems that it is no longer produced by WeMos. (I ordered one of this too). DOIT: I know nothing about it. Mini D1 (~$4.00): Another ESP8266-based module similar to the previous ones. It is produced by WeMos, the same as the NodeMCU LoLin. My theory is that WeMos realized that there was more money in trying to create their own ecosystem rather than just cloning NodeMCU. It has 11 GPIOs, instead of the 9 offered by Adafruit Huzzah, which is good (I ordered a few of this one too).\nThere were other alternatives, like the SparkFun Particle Photon ($19.00), based on non-ESP8266 micro-controllers. They were a bit more powerful, but also more expensive. And don\u0026rsquo;t support the Arduino IDE. So, for the moment I discarded them.\nSetting up LoLin NodeMCU CH340G drivers The first one to arrive was the LoLin NodeMCU (the Adafruit Feather Huzzah and the Mini D1 will arrive later this week), so I started playing with the NodeMCU.\nLoLin NodeMCU comes with a CH340G serial-to-USB interface (cheaper than than the other serial-to-USB alternatives?). And its drivers are not preinstalled on Mac, so:\nDownload and install the CH340G Mac drivers (direct link: CH34x_Install.zip) esptool This tool allows you to upload a firmware to the ESP8266 bootloader. I think it is not needed if you use the Arduino IDE, but it is a handy tool. To install it do:\n$ git clone https://github.com/themadinventor/esptool $ cd esptool $ python setup.py install Arduino IDE + esp8266 board Download Arduino IDE and then install the ESP8266 boards. The detailed instructions are here, but I\u0026rsquo;m copying \u0026amp; pasting them in case you are too lazy to follow the link:\nInstall Arduino 1.6.8 from the Arduino website. Start Arduino and open Preferences window. Enter http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json into Additional Board Manager URLs field. You can add multiple URLs, separating them with commas. Open Boards Manager from Tools \u0026gt; Board menu and install esp8266 platform (and don\u0026rsquo;t forget to select your ESP8266 board from Tools \u0026gt; Board menu after installation).

It worked for 2 or 3 weeks and it stopped working. The stepper and the motor weren\u0026rsquo;t moving. So I guessed that the \u0026ldquo;floppy drive\u0026rdquo; was broken.\nQuick introduction: the Commodore floppy disk drives have 2 major components:\nThe controller board: which has the 6502, RAM, ROM and other ICs to control the drive The floppy disk drive: which is the \u0026ldquo;thing\u0026rdquo; that has the header, the stepper, the motor to spin the floppy disk, etc. So, in my case, my quick guess was that the \u0026ldquo;floppy disk drive\u0026rdquo; was broken because the stepper and the motor were not moving.\nSo, I got different replacements:\nChinon FB-354 Rev. B: Was moving the stepper but making strange noises, so then I got a\u0026hellip; \u0026hellip;a Panasonic JU-257: Was moving the motor, but not the stepper, so then I got a\u0026hellip; \u0026hellip;a Chinon FB-354 Rev. E: Was not moving anything. Same symptoms as the original one. When you purchase untested things from Ebay is hit-or-miss. Sometimes they work, sometimes they don\u0026rsquo;t. But what are the chances of getting 3 broken floppy disk drives?\nSo, this time I decided to read more about the 1581 and I found this info that says:\nThe original fault with a failing 1770 was directory corruption. Other symptoms of a failing U4 include intermittent \u0026#34;file not found\u0026#34; and spindle motor not spinning when the drive is accessed. One recent U4 failure showed no stepper activity at power up (no \u0026#34;burp\u0026#34;), the green LED flashed once per second repeatedly and the spindle ran continuously. So my new guess is that I have 3 fully working floppy disk drives and one broken controller, in particular the WD-1770 IC which is responsible for controlling the floppy disk drive. The WD-1770 is soldered into the PCB, so desoldering skills are required\u0026hellip; which I have zero. So time to learn how to desolder ICs.

If we enter invalid codes, we won\u0026rsquo;t be able to play the game. Since Radare supports VICE Snapshot File format, we can save an snapshot of the game, and analyze it with Radare.\nIn VICE, go to the menu, Snapshot -\u0026gt; Save Snapshot Image\u0026hellip; If we select \u0026ldquo;Save ROMs\u0026rdquo;, then the BASIC ROM and the KERNAL ROM will be saved inside the Snapshot file, and will be included as Radare sections. Radare VICE Snapshot File (VSF) support lets us inspect:\nThe 64k RAM of the computer at the moment the snapshot was saved The BASIC and KERNAL ROMs in case they were saved. To open a VSF file, just pass the VSF file as the first argument:\n$ r2 bc_copy_protection_screen.vsf [0x00005689]\u0026gt; 0x00005689 is the PC (program counter) at the moment the snapshot was saved.\nRadare Sections With the command S we can inspect the S ections of the VSF file.\n[0x00005689]\u0026gt; S [00] . 0x0001209d mr-x va=0xa000 sz=0x2000 vsz=0x2000 BASIC [01] . 0x0001009d mr-x va=0xe000 sz=0x2000 vsz=0x2000 KERNAL [02] * 0x00000084 mrwx va=0x0000 sz=0x10000 vsz=0x10000 RAM With S=, we see the sections in a more visual way.\nAs we can see:\nBASIC starts at 0xa000 and it takes 8k KERNAL starts at 0xe000 and it takes 8k RAM starts at 0x0000, and takes 64k Let\u0026rsquo;s disassemble the KERNAL reset routine, the one at 64738:\n[0x0000fce2]\u0026gt; s 64738 [0x0000fce2]\u0026gt; pd 14 0xfce2 a2ff ldx #0xff 0xfce4 78 sei 0xfce5 9a txs 0xfce6 d8 cld 0xfce7 2002fd jsr 0xfd02 ┌─\u0026lt; 0xfcea d003 bne 0x03 │ 0xfcec 6c0080 jmp (0x8000) └─\u0026gt; 0xfcef 8e16d0 stx sym.VIC_CTRL2 0xfcf2 20a3fd jsr 0xfda3 0xfcf5 2050fd jsr 0xfd50 0xfcf8 2015fd jsr 0xfd15 0xfcfb 205bff jsr 0xff5b 0xfcfe 58 cli 0xfcff 6c00a0 jmp (0xa000) Actually we are not interested in disassembling the KERNAL at this moment, but we should know it is possible to do it. In case we want to disassemble the memory RAM that is beneath the KERNAL and/or BASIC we should remove the KERNAL and/or BASIC sections. We can add them again if needed. Use the S- command to remove Sections:\n0x0000fce2]\u0026gt; S [00] . 0x0001209d mr-x va=0xa000 sz=0x2000 vsz=0x2000 BASIC [01] * 0x0001009d mr-x va=0xe000 sz=0x2000 vsz=0x2000 KERNAL [02] . 0x00000084 mrwx va=0x0000 sz=0x10000 vsz=0x10000 RAM [0x0000fce2]\u0026gt; S-0 [0x0000fce2]\u0026gt; S-0 [0x0000fce2]\u0026gt; S [00] * 0x0001009d mr-x va=0xe000 sz=0x2000 vsz=0x2000 KERNAL And taking a look again at 64738 we find \u0026ldquo;nothing\u0026rdquo;, just \u0026ldquo;empty\u0026rdquo; RAM, which was expected:\n[0x0000fce2]\u0026gt; pd 14 0x0000fce2 ffffff isb 0xffff,x 0x0000fce5 ffffff isb 0xffff,x 0x0000fce8 ffffff isb 0xffff,x 0x0000fceb ffffff isb 0xffff,x 0x0000fcee ffffff isb 0xffff,x 0x0000fcf1 ffffff isb 0xffff,x 0x0000fcf4 ffffff isb 0xffff,x 0x0000fcf7 ffffff isb 0xffff,x 0x0000fcfa ffffff isb 0xffff,x 0x0000fcfd ffffff isb 0xffff,x Remember that by appending ? to any command, we can get help. In this case, S? will display the help for the S command.\nSymbols in Radare By doing a quick analysis of the snapshot, we can safely assume that the boot routine starts at 0x5500. So, let\u0026rsquo;s disassemble that address, and let\u0026rsquo;s see what we find:\nRadare will automatically import all the well-known symbols for the SID, VIC and CIA addresses. The symbols are imported in the symbols \u0026ldquo;flag space\u0026rdquo;. In order to display all the imported symbols, we should do:\n[0x00005689]\u0026gt; fs 0 0 . strings 1 101 . symbols 2 6 . sections [0x00005689]\u0026gt; fs symbols [0x00005689]\u0026gt; f 0x00005689 1 entry0 0x0000d000 2 sym.VIC_SPR0_X 0x0000d001 2 sym.VIC_SPR0_Y 0x0000d002 2 sym.VIC_SPR1_X 0x0000d003 2 sym.VIC_SPR1_Y 0x0000d004 2 sym.VIC_SPR2_X 0x0000d005 2 sym.VIC_SPR2_Y ... fs: displays all the available \u0026ldquo;flag spaces\u0026rdquo; fs name: switches to the selected \u0026ldquo;flag space\u0026rdquo; f: displays all the \u0026ldquo;flags\u0026rdquo; available in the selected \u0026ldquo;space\u0026rdquo; We can also grep for certain symbols. Let\u0026rsquo;s say that we want to know what are the CIA symbols.\n[0x00005689]\u0026gt; f~CIA 0x0000dc00 2 sym.CIA1_PRA 0x0000dc01 2 sym.CIA1_PRB 0x0000dc02 2 sym.CIA1_DDRA 0x0000dc03 2 sym.CIA1_DDRB 0x0000dc08 2 sym.CIA1_TOD10 0x0000dc09 2 sym.CIA1_TODSEC 0x0000dc0a 2 sym.CIA1_TODMIN 0x0000dc0b 2 sym.CIA1_TODHR ... Almost every command in Radare supports the ~ suffix which basically sends the output to grep (like pipes in Unix).\nIf we prefer raw addresses, we can just remove all the imported symbols by doing:\n[0x00005689]\u0026gt; f-sym.* And just remember that by appending ?, we can see the help for the f command, in this case: f?.\nRadare Variables So, after analyzing the boot code for a while we will realize that the 0x6000 looks suspicious, and it could be the address that we are looking for. So, let\u0026rsquo;s figure out is who calling 0x6000.\nAs we have seen in Part I, we can use /c or /x:\n[0x00005500]\u0026gt; /c jmp 0x6000 0x000056ea # 3: jmp 0x6000 [0x00005500]\u0026gt; /x 4c0060 Searching 3 bytes... # 7 [0x5500-0x10000] hits: 1 0x000056ea hit1_0 4c0060 One thing that we didn\u0026rsquo;t know is that we can tell Radare to automatically perform a command for all the \u0026ldquo;hits\u0026rdquo; found by editing the cmd.hit variable. For example, in order to disassemble the first 5 instructions automatically after each \u0026ldquo;hit\u0026rdquo;, we should do:\n[0x00005500]\u0026gt; e cmd.hit = pd 5 [0x00005500]\u0026gt; /x 4c0060 Searching 3 bytes... # 7 [0x5500-0x10000] hits: 1 0x000056ea hit3_0 4c0060 ;-- hit3_0: ┌─\u0026lt; 0x000056ea 4c0060 jmp 0x6000 │ 0x000056ed 20f856 jsr 0x56f8 │ 0x000056f0 c8 iny │ 0x000056f1 20f856 jsr 0x56f8 │ 0x000056f4 c8 iny Radare has many built-in variables that can be changed with the e command. To display all the available variables, just type e. You can grep certain variables by using the ~ suffix.\n[0x00005500]\u0026gt; e anal.a2f = false anal.afterjmp = false anal.arch = 6502 anal.bbsplit = true ... [0x00005500]\u0026gt; e~search anal.searchstringrefs = false search.align = 0 search.chunk = 0 search.contiguous = true search.count = 0 search.distance = 0 search.esilcombo = 8 search.flags = true ... Some variables support the ? argument. For example:\n[0x00005500]\u0026gt; e search.in=? raw block file io.maps io.maprange io.section io.sections io.sections.write io.sections.exec dbg.stack dbg.heap dbg.map dbg.maps dbg.maps.exec dbg.maps.write anal.fcn anal.bb The default option for search.in is file, which works Ok for us. But in some advance cases we might want to switch to either io.sections or io.section. More on this in future posts.\nCross references Actually the easiest way to find who is calling a certain function is to use cross references (xrefs). Just tell Radare to analyze the binary with aa:\n[0x00005500]\u0026gt; aa And then disassemble 0x6000 in Visual mode. While in Visual mode we can use the following shortcuts to navigate the xrefs:\nx: To open the \u0026ldquo;Goto xrefs\u0026rdquo; menu. It will appear at the top-left corner. Only available when we see a XREF legend above a function. Use 0-9 to jump to the displayed xrefs. Let\u0026rsquo;s see how to do it:\nModifying the game First of all, in order to be able to modify and save a VSF file, we should start Radare with the -w argument. Example:\n$ r2 -w bc_copy_protection_screen.vsf Now, let\u0026rsquo;s patch the game. After following the xrefs, we found that this is the code that jumps to 0x6000:\n│ │ 0x56c8 c502 cmp 0x02 │ ┌──\u0026lt; 0x56ca d003 bne 0x03 │ ┌───\u0026lt; 0x56cc 4cea56 jmp 0x56ea │ │└──\u0026gt; 0x56cf ad4f57 lda 0x574f One quick way to cheat the copy-protection is by replacing the bne 0x03 with two nop s.\nThe way to do it is by:\nEnter in Cursor mode (by pressing c) Position the cursor in the d003 values (from bne 0x03) Once the cursor is there, enter into Insert mode (by pressing i) Then type eaea (two nop s) and then enter Then q to quit Example: Reloading the VSF file in VICE So, we have just patched the VSF file. If you load it from VICE, the game will be patched and we will be able to play the game, even if we enter invalid color codes.\nJust open VICE -\u0026gt; Menu -\u0026gt; Snapshots -\u0026gt; Load Snapshot Image\u0026hellip;\nAnd when the game asks you to enter the color codes, just enter any code, and you should see the game screen:\nAdditional notes Radare also supports Commodore 128 VSF. If saved with ROMs, it will include the following sections: [00] * 0x420a1 mr-x va=0x4000 sz=0x7000 vsz=0x7000 BASIC [01] . 0x490a1 mr-x va=0xb000 sz=0x1000 vsz=0x1000 MONITOR [02] . 0x4a0a1 mr-x va=0xc000 sz=0x1000 vsz=0x1000 EDITOR [03] . 0x400a1 mr-x va=0xe000 sz=0x2000 vsz=0x2000 KERNAL [04] . 0x0008c mrwx va=0x0000 sz=0x10000 vsz=0x10000 RAM_BANK_0 [05] . 0x1008c mrwx va=0x0000 sz=0x10000 vsz=0x10000 RAM_BANK_1 In order to save VSF files for C128, use a recent VICE version from SVN. Radare VSF support was added a few days ago, so in order to use it, download Radare from Github VSF files are not meant to be \u0026ldquo;distributable\u0026rdquo; files. If you want to release a \u0026ldquo;crack\u0026rdquo; you should create .D64 or .PRG files. It is possible to create them from VSF files. More on this on future posts.

You need a recent version in order to disassemble 6502 code. And then install it by running sys/install.sh (or sys/user.sh for local installation): $ git clone https://github.com/radare/radare2.git $ cd radare2 $ ./sys/install.sh Loading a c64 .prg Radare has many command line options. But in order to load 6502 programs we need just two:\n-a6502 to specify the 6502 architecture. -mMemoryAddress to map the file to a certain memory address. Use 2047 for \u0026ldquo;normal\u0026rdquo; programs. Usually they start at $0801 (2049), but we have to subtract 2 from the .prg header. Example:\n$ r2 -a6502 -m2047 mygame.prg Disassembling Radare doesn\u0026rsquo;t have a GUI, like IDA. Instead is has a powerful command line interface (think of GDB). Example:\n$ r2 -a6502 -m2047 musicplayer.prg [0x000007ff]\u0026gt; And 0x7ff (2047) is the seek address, meaning that all commands will use that address as the base address. Let\u0026rsquo;s print the first 32 bytes. ( px = print hexa):\n[0x000007ff]\u0026gt; px 32 offset 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D E F 0123456789ABCDEF 0x07ff 0108 0b08 3905 9e32 3036 3100 0000 78ad ....9..2061...x. 0x080f 0ddc a212 a000 b9d4 1a99 f020 c8d0 f7ce ........... .... The \u0026ldquo;2061\u0026rdquo; that we see, is part of the BASIC \u0026ldquo;SYS 2061\u0026rdquo; command that usually appears in all C64 programs. So, let\u0026rsquo;s disassemble the first 12 instructions from 2061.

Examples:\nSearch for asm opcodes: /c opcode. The following will search for sta $d020, sta $d021, sta $d022, etc\u0026hellip;\n[0x0000080e]\u0026gt; /c sta 0xd02 0x00000829 # 3: sta 0xd020 0x0000082c # 3: sta 0xd021 Search for strings (although this is not very useful since most probably the strings are stored in screen codes and not in PETSCII):\n[0x0000080e]\u0026gt; / hello Search for a sequence of hexadecimal bytes: /x. The following searches for the MSB of the music frequency table:\n[0x0000080e]\u0026gt; /x 010101010102 Searching 6 bytes... # 7 [0x80d-0x13d4] hits: 1 0x0000098b hit0_0 010101010102 We can use the flag hit0_0 to refer to that address. For example, in order to dump the first 32 bytes from hit0_0 we can do:\n[0x080d]\u0026gt; px 32 @ hit0_0 offset 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D E F 0123456789ABCDEF 0x098c 0101 0101 0202 0202 0202 0203 0303 0303 ................ 0x099c 0404 0404 0505 0506 0607 0707 0808 0909 ................ For more search options just type /?\nVisual Mode Besides the Command Line Interface, Radare has another interface called the Visual Mode. It is similar to Vi, where each key has an associated function. In this mode, instead of entering commands, you just press one or two keys without pressing Enter.\nIn fact, some keys have the same Vi functionality:\nhjkl: move around gG: go top/bottom of page : : Enter a command Visual mode has 8 different view modes that can be activated by pressing p\nhex, the hexadecimal view disasm, the disassembly listing debug, the debugger words, the word-hexidecimal view buf, the C-formatted buffer annotated, the annotated op analysis color map annotated, the annotated hexdump Adding Comments While analyzing code, sometimes it is useful to add comments. While in Visual Mode, we can add comments by pressing ; plus the comment.\nExample: Saving After adding some comments, we should save the project in order not to loose the changes. To save a project just enter Ps projectName (Project save), and to open an existing project enter Po projectName (Project open). And enter Pl to list existing projects. Example:\n[0x0000080d]\u0026gt; Ps myproject myproject [0x0000080d]\u0026gt; Pl myproject [0x0000080d]\u0026gt; Po myproject Reloading project And from the command line, we can open existing projects with the -p argument. Example:\n$ r2 -p myproject Getting help Just append ? to each command to get more help about that command. Example:\n? :to list all the possible commands P? :to get help about the Project (P) command p? :to get help about the Print (p) command p8? :to get help about the Print 8bit hexpair command and so on. When in Visual Mode, also press ? to get help.\nOther resources Radare book IRC: irc.freenode.net #radare Twitter: @radareorg ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2015/11/18/disassembling-6502-code-with-radare-part-i/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://radare.org/\"\u003eRadare\u003c/a\u003e is an open source portable reversing framework that can do many things, among those things it can disassemble 6502 code.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"download-and-install-radare\"\u003eDownload and install radare\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFirst, download \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/radare/radare2\"\u003eradare from github\u003c/a\u003e.

Android Studio with C++ support: Finally :) The NDK really needs love, and having an IDE that supports it is great. Hey, even Microsoft is supporting the NDK now in VS2015. Photos is decoupled from Google+ with free unlimited storage: This is great. I\u0026rsquo;ve been using Picasa since day one and I never used Google+ to store my photos. So basically Photos is the same as Picasa, but with unlimited storage. Offline maps: Yeah Chrome Custom Tabs: Interesting alternative to present 3rd party views with the benefits of both the web and native worlds. What was not-that-interesting about the Keynote:\nThe rest. I don\u0026rsquo;t care if Android has better permissions or not (yeah, the old permissions-model sucked, but I don\u0026rsquo;t find that news interesting). The Family section for Google Play is good, but not interesting. Android Pay, meh. etc.\nOne thing that I liked, but was not announced on the Keynote, was Project Jacquard. They are using conductive threads and other stuff to create \u0026ldquo;smart\u0026rdquo; cloths. Something that Adafruit and Sparkfun have been doing for a while, BTW.\nIn general, I don\u0026rsquo;t find that interesting what is happening on the mobile phone space. Bigger phones? Meh. Lighter and thinner phones? Meh. Better camera? Meh. Faster phones? Meh. New API to do XXX and YYY? Meh.\nBut what I do find interesting is what is happening with IoT, micro-controllers, 3d printers, the maker movement, etc.\nAnd regarding watches, my take on them is: I don\u0026rsquo;t like to get interrupted. And the watch interrupts you all the time with the notifications. But if you turn them off the watch is not very useful. So you have to configure which notifications are important\u0026hellip; and that is something very difficult to do, at least today. Ah\u0026hellip; and don\u0026rsquo;t forget to charge it every single day. And this is true both for Apple Watch and Android Wear.\nOne thing that I didn\u0026rsquo;t like too much about Google I/O is that the talks were kind of shallow. They didn\u0026rsquo;t enter into technical details. I went to the \u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s new in Android Studio\u0026rdquo; because I wanted to learn more about NDK support, and the speaker spent no more than 10 minutes talking NDK support.

But a few months ago I decided to switch to Android.\nI tried Android devices before, but never as my default phone. At the beginning I started using a Samsung Galaxy S4 (a 2013 5\u0026quot; device), but later I switch to a Xiaomi MI4 (a 2014 5\u0026quot; device with better specs).\nWithout further ado, this is my feedback:\nLauncher In case you don\u0026rsquo;t know what the launcher is, think of the shell that allows you to launch the applications. It is the first thing that appears when you turn on the phone. In a way, it defines the UX.\nEach phone maker customize the Android launcher according to its needs. And you can also download 3rd party launchers. This is both a good thing and a bad thing.\nThe bad thing is that every phone maker have a different launcher, making it difficult to switch to other Android devices, since the UX is different. Google has its own launcher called Google Now Launcher, and tries hard to make sure that Android makers don\u0026rsquo;t differ too much from it, although that is not always true. Samsung, as an example, ships its phones with a launcher called TouchWiz. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t differ that much from Google Now Launcher, but its changes make it a worse phone, not a better one. Xiaomi, on the other hand, ships its phones with a completely different launcher which makes your Android device behave like an iOS device.\nThe good thing is that you can use a different launcher if you don\u0026rsquo;t like the default one (or create your own). This as a good thing because everything that can be configured, changed or replaced is an opportunity for innovation (see below).\nGoogle\u0026rsquo;s approach to the launcher is somewhat different than iOS. On the one hand, on iOS you place the applications on the \u0026ldquo;Application Layer\u0026rdquo; ( Springboard); if you remove an application from it, the application gets removed. The applications can be moved, or grouped as you want.\nOn the other hand, Google\u0026rsquo;s launcher has two layers: a kind of \u0026ldquo;Application Layer\u0026rdquo; ( App Drawer), where you can find all the installed applications, but in this case the applications are sorted alphabetically and can\u0026rsquo;t be grouped. And the \u0026ldquo;Home Screen Layer\u0026rdquo;, where you can group or rearrange the apps which is a layer on top of the \u0026ldquo;Application Layer\u0026rdquo; (think of the Desktop analogy for the PCs).\nThere are more differences between Android\u0026rsquo;s launcher and iOS\u0026rsquo; launcher, but I don\u0026rsquo;t want to enter into too much detail here besides saying that they are different, and I tend to prefer iOS approach, although Android\u0026rsquo;s approach has its strengths too.\nDefault Applications On Android, everything is \u0026ldquo;configurable\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;hackable\u0026rdquo;. You don\u0026rsquo;t want to use Chrome as your default browser ? You don\u0026rsquo;t like the default launcher? You don\u0026rsquo;t like the default camera application? You can change them. Truth be told, not every device offers the same degree of \u0026ldquo;hack-ability\u0026rdquo;. Samsung Galaxy S4, as an example, doesn\u0026rsquo;t offer as much customization as Xiaomi.\nBeing able to change different parts of your OS allows innovation. As an example, they keyboard Swype was created thanks to that. And this is a good thing.\nOn iOS, on the other hand, is the opposite. Apple controls the iOS experience almost too much. Only recently (iOS 8) Apple introduced APIs to hook with certain parts of the OS ( App Extensions), but it is still far away from the \u0026ldquo;hack-ability\u0026rdquo; of Android devices. As an example, it is still not possible to change the default browser on iOS.\nSoft buttons The soft buttons are the buttons that are at the bottom of the phone. They are called \u0026ldquo;soft buttons\u0026rdquo; because you don\u0026rsquo;t have to press them in order to activate them. Just a touch is enough.\nAndroid has 3 soft buttons:\nApplications button: Similar to the iOS double click on the home button Home button: Similar to the iOS single click on the home button Back button: N/A on iOS. I find the soft buttons error-prone. Sometimes when I\u0026rsquo;m writing an email or sending a message, instead of tapping the \u0026ldquo;space bar\u0026rdquo;, I, by mistake, activate the \u0026ldquo;Home button\u0026rdquo;, and the application \u0026ldquo;disappears\u0026rdquo;. At the beginning I thought that the application had crashed, until I discovered that I was activating the soft button.\nAnd that happens to me more often that I would like to. As an example, it happens to me while:\nWriting messages, email, etc. Playing games in portrait mode Giving my phone to someone else so he/she can see something on it The only benefit that I see on using soft buttons, is that they can be placed in any part of your phone. As an example, on the Nexus 7 tablet, if you rotate the tablet to landscape mode, the buttons will be placed at the bottom automatically.\nBut most of the phones don\u0026rsquo;t have that feature, why do I need soft buttons?\nOne issue is that some device makers put the \u0026ldquo;back\u0026rdquo; button at the bottom-left (Nexus 7), and others put the \u0026ldquo;back\u0026rdquo; button at the bottom-right (Xiaomi MI4 and Samsung S4). One bonus point for the Samsung S4 is that he \u0026ldquo;home\u0026rdquo; button is a real button and not a \u0026ldquo;soft button\u0026rdquo;.\nBack Button The Back Button sends you back to the \u0026ldquo;previous state\u0026rdquo;. On Chrome is like pressing the back button of the browser[*]; on applications that use navigation bar, the back button simulates pressing the \u0026ldquo;back arrow\u0026rdquo;. And in general this is a great feature that works as expected almost all the time. However it has some inconsistencies. Try the following experiment:\nOpen Yelp Press the \u0026ldquo;Home button\u0026rdquo; and launch Chrome Press the \u0026ldquo;Back button\u0026rdquo; What will happen? Well, it depends on the state of Chrome:\nIf there were no previous pages in the Chrome history, \u0026ldquo;back\u0026rdquo; will re-open Yelp But if you had browsed other pages before, \u0026ldquo;back\u0026rdquo; open the previous page that you have browsed. Also, on some non traditional applications the back button is used for things other than going back (should these applications be rejected?)\nBut despite its inconsistencies, I like this feature pretty well and I miss it when I use an iOS device.\nApplications and Games The applications that I use all the time are both on iOS and Android: Strava, Yelp, Uber, Chrome, Google Maps, Facebook, Skype, Twitter, etc.\nThe games, however, is somewhat different. Most of the games are on both platforms, but some games, specially created by small studios, are only available on iOS or arrive a few months later on Android.\nAt least Android has Humble Bundle games. There are some applications that are Android only basically due to App Store\u0026rsquo;s restrictions. As an example a Commodore 64 emulator and a SSH server are only available for Android (those are 2 real applications that I use from time to time).\nThe one thing that I miss from iOS, is Safari\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Reader mode\u0026rdquo;. There are some \u0026ldquo;Reader mode\u0026rdquo; extensions for Chrome Desktop, and it is possible to add a \u0026ldquo;Reader mode\u0026rdquo; by changing the chrome://flags on Chrome Mobile. But the option is so hidden, that I think nobody is using it (and is one of the most useful features for mobile browsing).\nBattery Life A few years ago, when I tried my first Android devices, I had the impression that their battery life were pretty bad. I don\u0026rsquo;t know if the battery life improved, and/or the OS and applications are more battery friendly, and/or I charge the phone more often since I have it with me all the time. But my impression is the battery life is comparable with iOS.\nSettings Application The 3 Android devices that I regularly use (Nexus 7, Xiaomi MI4 and Samsung S4) have completely different Settings application. The Settings is something that the launcher cannot change. So replacing the launcher with the Google Now Launcher won\u0026rsquo;t replace the Settings application.\nDifferences between them:\nNexus 7 + Android 5.0 has an easy to use Settings Xiaomi MI4 + MIUI6 + Android 4.4 has a Settings applications that is almost an exact copy of iOS settings Samsung Galaxy S4 + Android 4.4 has a Settings that is not easy to discover certain settings. Samsung and Xiaomi are trying to create the Samsung and Xiaomi experience. For Xiaomi, it makes sense to replace the official Android Settings with their own, since they want to clone the iOS experience as much as possible. But for Samsung, I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t know. They replaced the Google experience with a different one that is neither similar to iOS and more difficult to use than the Google\u0026rsquo;s one.\nXiaomi MI4 LTE issues The Xiaomi MI4 is a very good, inexpensive phone for people who want to try an Android device for the first time, but still want to have an \u0026ldquo;iOS experience\u0026rdquo;. The only issue that I have so far with it is that it doesn\u0026rsquo;t support LTE. Apparently the new version already supports it.\nFeature that I don\u0026rsquo;t miss from iOS The iOS keyboard, I don\u0026rsquo;t miss it at all. It is almost impossible to tell whether you are in lower or upper case.\nOn Android is simple:\nIf the keyboard is in Upper Case, the letters will appear in Upper Case Otherwise, they will appear in lower case Happy Holidays!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2014/12/24/switching-from-ios-to-android-my-experience/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eFor the past 5 or 6 years, I used iPhones as my default phones.

In this part (part II) I\u0026rsquo;ll describe how to render the particles using a basic water effect.\nPart I uses just one glDrawArrays(GL_POINTS, 0, total); to draw the particles. And although that works to draw \u0026ldquo;particles\u0026rdquo;, it is not enough to draw \u0026ldquo;water\u0026rdquo;.\nDrawing \u0026ldquo;water\u0026rdquo; requires a more complex rendering algorithm, like the one used in this example. And implementing an algorithm similar that one is what this article describes.\nThe algorithm works more or less like this:\nChoose a white circle and blur it. You can blur the circle at runtime Or you can blur it off-line. Create an a new frame-buffer (think of a clean off-screen buffer where you can render whatever you want) Render the particles into the newly created frame-buffer using the blurred circle Now render the frame-buffer into the main color-buffer using a threshold. The threshold could be something like this: If pixel.r \u0026lt; 0.1, discard the pixel (the pixel won\u0026rsquo;t be drawn) If pixel.r \u0026lt; 0.2, draw a blue pixel (for the border, although this is optional) else draw a white pixel (the inner part of the water) How to do it using Cocos2d-x and LiquidFun Let\u0026rsquo;s take the LFParticleSystemNode from Part I, and \u0026ldquo;evolve\u0026rdquo; it:\nThe first thing to do is to add the \u0026ldquo;off-screen\u0026rdquo; frame-buffer into the LFParticleSystemNode class. In Cocos2d-x, the \u0026ldquo;off-screen\u0026rdquo; buffers are created with the RenderTexture class. Example:\n[code language=\u0026ldquo;cpp\u0026rdquo;] bool LFParticleSystemNode::init(b2ParticleSystem* particleSystem, float ratio) { \u0026hellip; // create an off-screen frame-buffer with the size of the screen auto s = Director::getInstance()-\u0026gt;getWinSize(); _renderTexture = cocos2d::RenderTexture::create(s.width, s.height, Texture2D::PixelFormat::RGBA8888); this-\u0026gt;addChild(_renderTexture); _renderTexture-\u0026gt;setAnchorPoint(Point::ANCHOR_MIDDLE); _renderTexture-\u0026gt;setPosition(Point(s.width/2, s.height/2));\n// Change the default shader. Use a the threshold shader auto program = GLProgram::createWithByteArrays(_renderTextureShaderVert, _renderTextureShaderFrag); auto programState = GLProgramState::getOrCreateWithGLProgram(program); programState-\u0026gt;setUniformFloat(\u0026ldquo;u_threshold_discard\u0026rdquo;, 0.15); programState-\u0026gt;setUniformFloat(\u0026ldquo;u_threshold_border\u0026rdquo;, 0.3);\n\u0026hellip; } [/code]\nAnd, as mentioned earlier, the RenderTexture (the off-screen frame-buffer) needs a shader with a threshold. The threshold shader should look like the following:\n[code language=\u0026ldquo;cpp\u0026rdquo;] varying vec4 v_fragmentColor; varying vec2 v_texCoord; uniform float u_threshold_discard; uniform float u_threshold_border;\nvoid main() { vec4 color = v_fragmentColor * texture2D(CC_Texture0, v_texCoord); if( color.r \u0026lt; u_threshold_discard) // black or discard color = vec4(0,0,0,0); else if( color.r \u0026lt; u_threshold_border) // blue for the border color = vec4(0.2,0.2,0.9,1); else // white for the center color = vec4(1,1,1,1); gl_FragColor = color; } [/code]\nThe values u_threshold_discard, and u_threshold_border are defined at runtime. In the example, they are set at 0.15 and 0.3 respectively.\nThe next thing to do is, to render the particles in the RenderTexture.\n[code language=\u0026ldquo;cpp\u0026rdquo;]void LFParticleSystemNode::draw(Renderer *renderer, const Mat4 \u0026amp;transform, uint32_t transformFlags) { // tell RenderTexture to \u0026ldquo;capture\u0026rdquo; the particles _renderTexture-\u0026gt;beginWithClear(0,0,0,0);\n_customCommand.init(_globalZOrder); _customCommand.func = CC_CALLBACK_0(LFParticleSystemNode::onDraw, this, transform, transformFlags); renderer-\u0026gt;addCommand(\u0026amp;_customCommand);\n// tell RenderTexture to stop \u0026ldquo;capturing\u0026rdquo; the particles _renderTexture-\u0026gt;end(); } [/code]\nThe result is the following Further improvements What I described is just a simple algorithm to render water. But more advanced (and better looking) algorithms could be implemented using the same principle:\nRender blurred (or any other effect) particles into an off-screen buffer Render the off-screen buffer with an special shader As an example, the official \u0026ldquo;LiquidFun - EyeCandy\u0026rdquo; sample from Google uses a much more complex shader that involves lighting, refraction, and distortion in the background.\nCustomizing shaders in Cocos2d-x v3.1+ Cocos2d-x v3.1 introduced a new way to customize shaders. The same GLProgram works like in v3.0, but if you want to add custom attributes or uniforms, instead of subclassing GLProgram, you can can do it by using the GLProgramState class. Subclassing GLProgram still works, but the recommend way is to use GLProgramState. It works like this:\n[code language=\u0026ldquo;cpp\u0026rdquo;] // you create a GLProgram like in v3.0 GLProgram* glprogram = GLProgram::createWithByteArrays(_particleShaderVert, _particleShaderFrag);\n// and then you create a GLProgramState with it GLProgramState* glprogramstate = GLProgramState::getOrCreateWithGLProgram(glprogram);\n// attach the ProgramState to a Node sprite-\u0026gt;setGLProgramState( glprogramstate ); [/code]\nThe next thing to do is to add custom uniforms and/or attributes using the GLProgramState API.\nAdding custom uniforms:\n[code language=\u0026ldquo;cpp\u0026rdquo;] // setting a float glprogramstate-\u0026gt;setUniformFloat(\u0026ldquo;u_name_1\u0026rdquo;, 0.15f);\n// setting a vec2 glprogramstate-\u0026gt;setUniformVec2(\u0026ldquo;u_name_2\u0026rdquo;, Vec2(0.2, 0.3));\n// setting a callback glprogramstate-\u0026gt;setUniformCallback(\u0026ldquo;uniform_name_2\u0026rdquo;, [](GLProgram* program, Uniform* uniform){ glUniform4fv( uniform-\u0026gt;location, 10, _buffer); }); [/code]\nAnd the same is true for attributes:\n[code language=\u0026ldquo;cpp\u0026rdquo;] // setting an attribute pointer glprogramstate-\u0026gt;setVertexAttribPointer(\u0026ldquo;a_position\u0026rdquo;, 2, GL_FLOAT, GL_FALSE, 0, _particleSystem-\u0026gt;GetPositionBuffer());\n// setting a callback glprogramstate-\u0026gt;setVertexAttribCallback(\u0026ldquo;a_color\u0026rdquo;, [](VertexAttrib* vertexAttrib) { glVertexAttrib4f(vertexAttrib-\u0026gt;index, 0.2, 0.8, 0.7, 1.0); }); [/code]\nDownload and running the sample Clone the cocos2d-x-samples repo and follow its instructions. Then launch the \u0026ldquo;LiquidFun - EyeCandy\u0026rdquo; demo.\n$ git clone https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x-samples.git \u0026hellip; and follow instructions from the site.

These are my thoughts:\nSwift Swift is a new programming language by Apple.\nAt first sight, it seems to be easier to learn and easier to master than Objective-C. Objective-C is not particular difficult to learn and master, but its syntax looks foreign to C# / C++ / Python developers.\nSwift, on the other hand, has a more conventional design. You can read Swift code the same way you can read C# code, even if you are not a Swift or C# developer.\nSwift is a compiled language, although it looks like an scripting language. It is strongly typed, it is object-oriented with functional features. It does not have garbage collection. It uses ARC instead.\nYou can call any Objective-C API from Swift (at least Apple\u0026rsquo;s APIs) , and Apple claims it is faster than Objective-C. Objective-C wasn\u0026rsquo;t the fastest language out there, but it wasn\u0026rsquo;t particularly slow either.\nPerhaps the killer feature for me is Playground, a kind of sandbox for testing ideas / rapid development / rapid prototyping. BTW, Playground seems to be inspired (or copied if you prefer) from Bret Victor\u0026rsquo;s Inventing on Principle talk, which is a MUST WATCH video for everybody.\nAlso, Swift has pretty much what John Siracusa asked for in his Copland 2010 article.\nSo, if Swift is easier to learn, easier to master, less error-prone, faster to develop code, performs better than Objective-C and you can call Objective-C code from it, why Apple should keep adding features to Objective-C ?\nI expect that:\nObjective-C code will be supported on iOS / OS X for the foreseeable future. But new APIs will be added on Swift only. Developers will be forced to migrate to Swift to use the new ones (similar to what happened years ago with Carbon vs. Cocoa APIs ). Unknowns:\nCan you call any Objective-C library from it ? or only Apple\u0026rsquo;s APIs ? Will Apple release the binding generator ? [UPDATE]: Yes, it is possible to call 3rd party Obj-C libraries from Swift. Will Apple open source the language ? Or at least submit the language to the standard committee ? Can you call C and/or C++ libraries from it ? For me:\nSwift is a very attractive language, so if Apple decides to open source it, it has the potential to gain a lot of developers from other platforms as well. I would definitely use it, and would seriously analyze the possibility of porting cocos2d to it. Bret Victor\u0026rsquo;s Inventing on Principle was very inspiring. Since the day I watched that video, I wanted to add similar features to cocos2d. Playground showed us that it is possible to do it with a compiled language. Metal Metal is an API that lets you talk to the GPU in a more direct (but non cross-platform) way than OpenGL.\nApple claims that it is 10x faster than OpenGL ES when drawing, although I usually take those numbers with grain of salt. Don\u0026rsquo;t get me wrong, Metal probably is much faster than OpenGL ES, and a 3X would already be compelling reason to support Metal\u0026hellip; it is just that the numbers presented at the Keynote are not always very accurate.\nIt supports:\nMulti-threading Pre-compiled shaders And I think we are allowed to use the GPU for general computing. Think of OpenCL (I have to double check this). So\u0026hellip;:\nFor game players, this is great news. They will be able to play more graphics-intensive games on Apple\u0026rsquo;s devices. For game engine developers, this means more work. Eventually, we will add Metal support in cocos2d-x. For Android\u0026hellip; well, I guess they will need to add something similar, otherwise games on high-end Apple devices will perform much much better than on high end Android devices. Apple has a big edge here, because it is easier to create an API like Metal for iOS than for Android, since Apple controls the GPU and writes its drivers\u0026hellip; and Google doesn\u0026rsquo;t. For Windows Phone: I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if Direct3D on Windows Phone 8 is already that fast or not. And an Apple TV with Metal + Game Controllers, could be a serious competition for the console market. SpriteKit / SceneKit SpriteKit was introduced at WWDC 13. It is a clone of cocos2d with some nice improvements. And SceneKit is a 3d renderer. It has been in OS X for while, but it will included in iOS8 too.\nSpriteKit and SceneKit seems to be Apple\u0026rsquo;s bet for creating casual / mid-core games. And with Swift, they are a great combination\u0026hellip; assuming that you are interested on iOS only.\nIf you are interested in developing casual/mid-core multi-platform games, you should try something like cocos2d-x, of course :-) Recently we started adding 3d features: in v3.1 we added Sprite3D, in v3.2 we will add 3d animations, and in v3.3 we will add lights and other effects.\nMisc observations Tim Cook said that 50% of the Chinese iPhone users were coming from Android. That is misleading. In China, almost everybody has an Android phone. And Apple introduced iPhone on China at the end of last year. So of course that most of the Chinese iPhone users came from Android. I\u0026rsquo;m surprised that that number was not 100%. (That is just one of the reasons why I take the Apple\u0026rsquo;s numbers with a grain of salt) Why bashing Android ? Is Apple so afraid of Android ? I mean, leave the WWDC for developers-only news and use marketing events for bashing the competition. I really liked the new iOS additions: Continuity, the new features for iMessage, and sharing the phone with the Mac\u0026hellip; Some of them are totally rip-off of other products. And although Apple innovates, Apple also copies.

Game developers can use it for new game mechanics and add realistic physics to game play. Designers can use the library to create beautiful fluid interactive experiences.\nBasically LiquidFun is Box2d plus an extension to simulate fluids using a particle system. To test it, download and install the official LiquidFun - Testbed, and LiquidFun - EyeCandy for Android.\nCocos2d-x already has Box2d integration, so in order to integrate Cocos2d-x with LiquidFun, we only need to integrate this new class: b2ParticleSystem.\nLiquidFun\u0026rsquo;s b2ParticleSystem I\u0026rsquo;m not going to describe how to use LiquidFun (for that, read its programmers guide). Instead, I\u0026rsquo;m going to describe how to integrate b2ParticleSystem in Cocos2d-x (also applicable to any other game engine).\nFor the integration, what we need is a Cocos2d-x node that knows how to render a b2ParticleSystem. And b2ParticleSystem has these 4 useful methods:\n[code language=\u0026ldquo;cpp\u0026rdquo;] class b2ParticleSystem { \u0026hellip; // Get the number of particles. int32 GetParticleCount() const;\n// Get the particle radius. float32 GetRadius() const;\n// Get the position of each particle in Box2d\u0026rsquo;s coordinate system // Array is length GetParticleCount() b2Vec2* GetPositionBuffer();\n// Get the color of each particle in RGBA Uint8 format. // Array is length GetParticleCount() b2ParticleColor* GetColorBuffer(); }; [/code]\nIdeally we should be able to reuse cocos2d::ParticleSystemQuad for the rendering, but we can\u0026rsquo;t because:\ncocos2d::ParticleSystemQuad doesn\u0026rsquo;t support changing the attractor (this is a design bug, we need to fix it). A nil attractor would be needed for this case. ParticleSystemQuad works with Quads, and not Points. And even if Points were supported (like in Cocos2d-x v1), it wouldn\u0026rsquo;t work because the points and colors should be in an interleaved array. The other issue is the conversion between Box2d and Cocos2d-x coordinate system, but it would be easy to fix. Points vs. Quads The major drawback of using Points (instead of Quads), is that you cannot rotate a Point (spinning). And that\u0026rsquo;s why we are not using them on Cocos2d-x.\nAnd the benefits of using Points (instead of Quads) are that less memory is required, and that means that it could be faster. As an example:\nPoint uses one point for the position (instead of 4 for the quad) Point uses one color (instead of 4) Point doesn\u0026rsquo;t need the UV coordinates (zero points instead of 4) But if you want to use different sizes, you need to pass an array of floats (not needed if you are using quads). And from LiquidFun\u0026rsquo;s point of view, it is cheaper to do collision detection with circles (point + radius) than with quads It is noteworthy that LiquidFun\u0026rsquo;s goal is to simulate fluids. And since in fluids you don\u0026rsquo;t need to spin the particles, LiquidFun uses Points (since they take less memory and they are faster).\nDrawing using GL_POINTS In OpenGL / OpenGL ES you can draw points using GL_POINTS, but it has certain limitations:\nIt is not possible to rotate them (already discussed) If you scale the particle (by using gl_PointSize), you cannot scale the X-axis independent from the Y-axis. Points can use textures as well, but you cannot change the u-v coordinates. Either you use the full texture, or nothing. If you haven\u0026rsquo;t used GL_POINTS before, this is how the code should look like:\n[code language=\u0026ldquo;cpp\u0026rdquo;] // Create the array of positions. They are in Box2d\u0026rsquo;s coordinate system // The will be converted later to cocos2d\u0026rsquo;s coordinate system void *positions = _particleSystem-\u0026gt;GetPositionBuffer(); glVertexAttribPointer(position_index, 2, GL_FLOAT, GL_FALSE, 0, positions); glEnableVertexAttribArray(position_index);\n// Array of colors. Format is: R,G,B,A unsigned bytes void *colors= _particleSystem-\u0026gt;GetColorBuffer(); glVertexAttribPointer(color_index, 4, GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE, GL_TRUE, 0, colors); glEnableVertexAttribArray(color_index);\n// Array of sizes. particle_size is an array of floats. The user should create it. // This is an optional feature in order to have different sizes for the particles. glVertexAttribPointer(particlesize_index, 1, GL_FLOAT, GL_FALSE, 0, particle_size); glEnableVertexAttribArray(particlesize_index);\n// Draw them as points glDrawArrays(GL_POINTS, 0, _particleSystem-\u0026gt;GetParticleCount()); [/code]\nConverting positions from Box2d to Cocos2d-x coordinate system Cocos2d-x v3.0 passes the Model View matrix to the draw() method. And what we need to do is to transform it so that we can use the Positions that are in Box2d\u0026rsquo;s coordinate system. And this is what we should do:\n[code language=\u0026ldquo;cpp\u0026rdquo;] class LFParticleSystemNode : public cocos2d::Node { \u0026hellip; // ivar for the scaling transform kmMat4 _ratioTransform; }\nbool LFParticleSystemNode::init(b2ParticleSystem* particleSystem, float ratio) { \u0026hellip; // Pixels to Meters ratio: converts Box2d into cocos2d kmMat4Scaling(\u0026amp;_ratioTransform, ratio, ratio, 1); \u0026hellip; }\nvoid LFParticleSystemNode::onDraw(const kmMat4 \u0026amp;modelViewTransform, bool transformUpdated) { // A new model view will be used, which lets us render the particles in cocos2d coordinate system // newMV = modelViewTransform * _ratioTransform kmMat4 newMV; kmMat4Multiply(\u0026amp;newMV, \u0026amp;modelViewTransform, \u0026amp;_ratioTransform); _shaderProgram-\u0026gt;use(); _shaderProgram-\u0026gt;setUniformsForBuiltins(newMV); \u0026hellip; } [/code]\nChanging the size with gl_PointSize Another thing that is missing is to scale up/down the Points according to the \u0026ldquo;world\u0026rdquo; scale. And this is how we do it:\n[code language=\u0026ldquo;cpp\u0026rdquo;] // Vertex Shader attribute vec4 a_position; attribute vec4 a_color; attribute float a_size;\nvoid main() { // CC_PMatrix = Projection Matrix // CC_MVMatrix = ModelView Matrix gl_Position = CC_PMatrix * CC_MVMatrix * a_position;\n// This is the trick to scale up/down the points: // The ModelView matrix has the ScaleX value in [0][0], and ScaleY value in [1][1] // Unfortunately we can only use either ScaleX or ScaleY, but not both. gl_PointSize = CC_MVMatrix[0][0] * a_size; v_fragmentColor = a_color; } [/code]\nTexture Coordiantes with gl_PointCoord The final thing to do, is use a texture for the particles, otherwise we will see a square. As I mentioned before, you cannot pass u-v coordinates for GL_POINTS. Instead, we are going to use the predefined variable called gl_PointCoord. Example:\n[code language=\u0026ldquo;cpp\u0026rdquo;] // Fragment Shader uniform sampler2D CC_Texture0;\nvarying vec4 v_fragmentColor; void main() { // gl_PointCoord has the current \u0026ldquo;pixel\u0026rdquo; for the fragment // It uses the full texture. We can\u0026rsquo;t use a \u0026ldquo;subrect\u0026rdquo; for this. gl_FragColor = v_fragmentColor * texture2D(CC_Texture0, gl_PointCoord); } [/code]\nAnd that\u0026rsquo;s all!\nThe complete LFParticleSystemNode code can be found here:\nLFParticleSystemNode.cpp And the full working example can be downloaded from here:\ncocos2d-x-samples: Try both LiquidFun-EyeCandy and LiquidFun-Testbed samples. In Part II, I\u0026rsquo;ll describe the steps needed to integrate LiquidFun with cocos2d-x for Win32 + Visual Studio.

But the problem is that a lot of programs are not ready to run in High-DPI mode. All Qt and GTK based applications look horrible; even some Microsoft applications like Skype don\u0026rsquo;t look OK; the YouTube flash player looks too small; Havok Anarchy is unusable on this notebook; Eclipse icons are too small; and so on. adb doesn\u0026rsquo;t recognize my Nexus 7. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure why yet. It comes with Windows 8.1, instead of Windows 8.1 Pro The display is \u0026ldquo;touch\u0026rdquo;. Why do I need one? I cannot clean the display with my fingers. Is there a way to disable this feature? Although I found it useful to play 10000000. The touchpad is OKish, not great, but not terrible either. But I was expecting something of higher quality, given that this is a top-end notebook. Overall:\nI was looking for a MacBook Retina Display-like notebook for Windows.

Quality-wise, Android is also the cheapest. Developing for the NDK is very expensive (time-wise). So in the end developing for Android is much more expensive than developing for iOS (I don\u0026rsquo;t know yet how expensive is to develop for WinPhone). iOS developers\u0026rsquo; experience is years ahead of Android\u0026rsquo;s. Developing and debugging for Android\u0026rsquo;s NDK reminds me when I was developing for Linux in the 90s. Google, come one, please give us a good C++ IDE for the NDK. You can develop Android apps using Mac, Windows or Linux. But you need a Mac to develop for iOS. And you need a PC in order to develop for Windows Phone. Xcode became a great IDE. Not only because of compiler improvements, but also of how well it is integrated with iOS: OpenGL Frame grabber, GPU analysis, memory leak detection, CPU profiler, etc. Six years ago, Visual Studio was the best IDE out there. It was way ahead of Xcode. I\u0026rsquo;m eager to use VS again. I\u0026rsquo;ll let you know my findings.

El Jueves por la mañana, con Tom, tomamos un vuelo desde Oakland a Salt Lake City (SLC). Ahí alquilamos auto y fuimos hasta Moab, previo almuerzo en Price (pueblo que queda a mitad de camino). El camino desde SLC hasta Moab es muy pintoresco: montañitas, curvas, subidas, bajadas, algo de nieve, desierto, frio, calor\u0026hellip;\nAntes de llegar a Moab, entramos en el Arches National Park y fuimos a ver el Delicate Arch. Simpatica roca. Ahí nos encontramos con Tomas y Landon. Sacamos varias fotos y de ahí al condo, donde nos encontramos con Rolf.\nViernes Desayuno, monos en la camioneta de Rolf, y listo. Partimos los 5 monociclistas a Slickrock, un trail excelente como si fuese Marte. Es un loop de unos 16 kilómetros con subidas y bajadas, pocos arboles, sobre el rio Colorado.\nCreo que en el kilometro dos o tres rompí 3 rayos, y no pude seguir. Por suerte Tomas había llevado dos monociclos: uno de 24\u0026quot; y otro de 36\u0026quot;. Fui rápido a la camioneta a buscar el mono de repuesto e hice el loop en \u0026ldquo;contra mano\u0026rdquo; para poder encontrame con los chicos. Los encontré a mitad de camino.\nRolf también rompió mono: se le rompió la palanca y no pudo seguir. Así que con Rolf nos turnamos el mono de repuesto. Fue un gran día. Habremos hecho el loop en unas 5 horas.\nSábado Nuevamente empacamos todo en la camioneta de Rolf. Morgan y Josh ya se habían unido al grupo. Era el turno de hacer Porcupine Rim, un trail largo y técnico. Si bien Slickrock no es fácil, no se puede decir que es técnico. Porcupine Rim tampoco es un trail puramente técnico\u0026hellip; es más bien un trail muy largo (de unos 25km) con partes super técnicas.\nEmpezamos el trail en UPS (Upper Porcupine Singletrack). Empieza a unos 2.500 metros de altura, lo que cual no es poco. Creo que la altura, sumado al calor, sumado al cansancio del día anterior hicieron que a las pocas horas no de más, y casi sin agua (y eso que llevaba encima casi 5 litros)\u0026hellip; Y aún no habíamos hecho ni la mitad del trail.\nPero tenía que seguir. Había esperado ese día durante un año entero. Así que seguí con las fuerzas que me quedaban. El grupo iba mucho más rápido que yo. Tom y Landon me esperaron. Tomas iba bastante rápido y Rolf lo seguía. Tom me acompaño los últimos 6 o 7 km\u0026hellip; los kilometros más divertidos del trail donde estan todos los \u0026ldquo;drops\u0026rdquo; y las partes técnicas. Si bien no tenía casi fuerzas, tenia la suficiente fuerza para hacer todo lo técnico. Pude terminar el trail (sin agua), casi sin energía, pero puede hacer todas las pruebas que me quise hacer\u0026hellip; y que no eran fáciles. Tardé como 8 horas en hacer todo el trail.\nDomingo Dos días super de monociclo in-extremis fueron demasiado para mi. Así que el Domingo no hice casi nada: pasear un poco por el pueblo, lavar la ropa y manejar hasta SLC.\nFotos Fotos: Moab 2013\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2013/04/09/moab-2013/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"jueves\"\u003eJueves\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-2h2N5dQNCHI/UWLcMZIECJI/AAAAAAAAtnQ/Rrz_d4v1zDU/s400/P1000474.JPG\"\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-2h2N5dQNCHI/UWLcMZIECJI/AAAAAAAAtnQ/Rrz_d4v1zDU/s400/P1000474.JPG\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\nY llegó el día esperado.

Wolfgang me dice: \u0026ldquo;Me fije y esta rueda soporta como máximo 6 PSI, y mi inflador soporta cerca de 6 PSI, así que lo llenamos\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Ok\u0026rdquo;, dije yo\u0026hellip; y lo llenamos con 5,5 PSI. Nunca había andado con un mono con tanta presión en la rueda\u0026hellip; volaba el mono\u0026hellip; increíble.\nEl jueves y viernes hice algunas pruebas con el monociclo, sobre todo probé el asiento, la velocidad y la altura\u0026hellip; casi todo joyita. Salvo un par de cosas que me llamaron la atención:\nLa cubierta soportaba una presión máxima de 5 PSI, y no 6 PSI\u0026hellip; y le habíamos puesto 5,5 PSI\u0026hellip; ¿Se puede reventar la cubierta? Yo que se\u0026hellip; espero que no. El sábado a la mañana nos fuimos a Düsseldorf. Retiramos el chip, y compré algunos geles. Acá apareció una nueva duda: - \u0026ldquo;No, no podes tomar 2 geles, vas a vomitar\u0026rdquo; - me decía el vendedor - \u0026ldquo;No, ese sobre tiene como 2 dosis, lo tenes que dosificar mucho\u0026rdquo;, me volvía a decir el vendedor - \u0026ldquo;No, ya te dije que no podes tomar 2 de esos\u0026rdquo; - \u0026ldquo;No, ese gel es para tomar 15 minutos antes de la carrera, y no durante\u0026rdquo;\nClaro, los geles estaban en alemán, y el tipo hablaba poco ingles.\n\u0026quot;¿Pero por qué no me traje los geles de Bs.As?\u0026quot; - pensaba yo\u0026hellip; en verdad me había traído 1, el último que me quedaba. Para los que no saben, el \u0026ldquo;gel\u0026rdquo; es una mezcla de proteinas líquida\u0026hellip; en vez de comer una banana o una barra de cereal, este hace efecto más inmediato porque es líquido y no hay que hacer tanta digestión.\n\u0026ldquo;Má si\u0026rdquo;, dije yo, \u0026ldquo;dame 4 de estos y que sea lo que Dios quiera\u0026rdquo;. El sábado a la noche fuimos a comer pasta con los monociclistas a un boliche de por ahí, y a ahí me explicaron una nueva regla:\nSi vas a ritmo de cruzar la meta junto con los corredores Elite(que corren con pies, y largan 15 minutos después que nosotros), entonces los organizadores te van a parar por 1 o 2 minutos 500 metros antes de la meta, así los corredores pueden cruzar la meta \u0026ldquo;limpios\u0026rdquo;, sin ningún monociclista que les arruine la foto. Nos fuimos a dormir. Estaba cansadísimo. Pongo el despertador a las 6:00\u0026hellip; Me despierto solo. ¿Qué hora es? ¿Las 5:50?. No\u0026hellip; eran las 3:45\u0026hellip; y no pude dormir más. Eran los nervios pre carrera. Ya me había pasado lo mismo el año pasado.\nDesayuné normal, ni liviano, ni fuerte. Habían pronosticado lluvia y viento\u0026hellip; Hacían como 5 grados\u0026hellip; argh\u0026hellip; Si hay algo peor que correr con viento y lluvia, es viento, lluvia y frio. Armo la mochila: 2 litros de agua, caramañolas con el gel mezcladas con agua, inflador, herramientas, vaselina, GPS.\n8:30: entrada en calor, estirar un poco los cuadriceps, saludar a los muchachos, fotos de rigor. 9:00: un poco más de vaselina\u0026hellip; hay que cuidar los gobelins. 9:15: se largó!!!\nKm 1: ¿Cuanto hice? ¿3m 15s? Mmm\u0026hellip; yo espero hacer 3m 45s por km\u0026hellip; estoy yendo muy rápido, me voy a fundir si voy a este ritmo. Ah\u0026hellip; es que siempre el 1er km esta mal medido\nUh.. ¿que le paso a ese pibe? No te puedo creer\u0026hellip; se le reventó la rueda\u0026hellip; ¡que garrón! ¿Le habrá puesto presión de más? Argh\u0026hellip;\nKm 2: ¿Qué? ¿3m 11s? Algo esta muy mal\u0026hellip; o los km son más cortos en Alemania, o mi reloj va más lento.\nKm 3: ¿3m 13s? Mmm\u0026hellip; No estoy nada cansado\u0026hellip; ¿será que estoy bien entrenado? ¿será el nuevo monociclo?\nLos músculos ya entraron en calor\u0026hellip; Por suerte no hay viento\u0026hellip; y tampoco lluvia.\nKm 4: ¿Dónde esta el km 4? ¿Ahí viene el km 5, o ese es el 6? ¿8m 27s?\u0026hellip; Algo esta esta mal\u0026hellip; o hice 2 km largos o 3 km cortos, o voy muy rápido, o muy lento.\nKm 7: Ahí esta La Bombi sacando fotos\u0026hellip; aca estoy\u0026hellip; sacame fotito que me gusta :-)\nKm 10: ¿Cuanto voy? 31m 24s\u0026hellip; vengo a las chapas.\nKm 12: Estoy cerca de los 40m\u0026hellip; vamos con el 1er Gel\u0026hellip;. Mmmm\u0026hellip; que gusto horrible que tiene. ¿Vomitaré?\nKm 21,1 (mitad de carrera): 1h 09m 11s. Bastante bien\n\u0026ldquo;Gobelins, ¿como vienen?\u0026rdquo;, les pregunto yo \u0026ldquo;Sin problemas por ahora\u0026rdquo;, me contestan A 300 metros veo un monociclista\u0026hellip; dale que lo alcanzo.\nKm 24: Segundo Gel\u0026hellip; Ah\u0026hellip; este es más rico.\nLlueve muy poco\u0026hellip;\nKm 26: \u0026quot;¡¡¡Correte!!!\u0026quot;, le grito a una señora que se cruza para sacar fotos a los que venian de frente\u0026hellip; casi la atropello a la idiota.\nArgh\u0026hellip; la cantidad de vias que hay que cruzar\u0026hellip; por Dios\u0026hellip; Escucho un \u0026ldquo;PLOP\u0026rdquo;. \u0026ldquo;No\u0026hellip; creo que pinche rueda\u0026hellip; maldita presión\u0026rdquo;. Miro la rueda y estaba bien\u0026hellip; parece que pasé por arriba de algo que explotó.\nKm 30: 1h 39m\u0026hellip; Vengo bien\u0026hellip; bueno, si se me llega a reventar la rueda ahora, hago los últimos 12km corriendo.\nKm 36: 3er y último Gel. Faltan 6km. ¿Qué hago? ¿Le doy a toda máquina ahora? No, mejor espero unos km más.\n\u0026ldquo;Rhiii - cahrrr - dooo\u0026rdquo;, gritan por ahí\u0026hellip;. Mi nombre estaba impreso en el número. También gritaban muchas otras cosas, pero no entendía ni jota de lo que decían.\nKm 37: Alcancé a una monociclista\u0026hellip;\nKm 40: Veo que el 1er corredor (que corre con pies) esta cerca\u0026hellip; Le doy a toda máquina\u0026hellip; Paso a la monociclista.\nKm 41: Boludo, vengo a las chapas\u0026hellip; ¿de donde estoy sacando toda esta fuerza?\u0026hellip; Uh\u0026hellip; mira vos\u0026hellip; estoy pasando a otro pibe.\nDebo estar yendo a más de 20km/h\u0026hellip; entre 22 y 23 km/h\u0026hellip; estoy yendo muy rápido\u0026hellip; Parece que el 1er corredor esta muy cerca. Los de la organización me piden que acelere. Más rápido que esto no puedo ir.\nEl auto de la organización me toca bocina para que me corra\u0026hellip; Pero auto de #$!#$, ¿No te das cuenta que no hay lugar para que me corra? Más bocinazos\u0026hellip; ¿No te das cuenta que no me puedo correr? CRASH\u0026hellip;.ARGH\u0026hellip;ARGH\u0026hellip;. ARGH\u0026hellip;. Palo terrible que me di\u0026hellip; estoy todo hecho bola. Sangre en las 2 rodillas y codo\u0026hellip; El auto no me pisa de casualidad. Me trato de subir al mono, pero no puedo\u0026hellip; la piernas me tiemblan. Me pasan los 2 monociclistas que había pasado\u0026hellip; me logro subir\u0026hellip; Pongo 1ra, 2da, 3ra, 4ta, 5ta\u0026hellip; Tengo que llegar antes que el 1er corredor\u0026hellip;. si\u0026hellip; llegué. Terminé los 42k en 2h 21m 02s. Increíble tiempo\u0026hellip; y yo que pensaba hacer 2h 38m. Hice 42 minutos menos que el año pasado\u0026hellip; 42 minutos menos (1 minuto menos por kilometro).\nDucha caliente, enfermería (me curaron las heridas\u0026hellip; nada grave), comer algo y ver entrega de premios.\nDüsseldorf, ¡Será hasta el próximo año!\nGracias Bombita por acompañarme, amigos por apoyarme, Ale Terzo por entrenarme.\nAlgunas fotos: Fotos del maratón Düsseldorf 2010 Update 1: La presión de la rueda estaba en BARs y no PSI.\nUpdate 2: El auto que me tocaba bocina, no es que me tocaba bocina a mi en particular, si no que va toda la carrera tocando bocina.\nUpdate 3: No mamá, el gel no es doping :-). Es como si fuera una barra de cereal concentrada. El buen rendimiento se debió gracias al entrenamiento y a tener un mucho mejor monociclo.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2010/05/03/marathon-dusseldorf-2010-relato/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/Xtd9wNH9dkZVY1OYLPa-VafYwRgzAYAn4fRorFN3JfQ?feat=embedwebsite\"\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://lh6.ggpht.com/_7Tp7oCOlWFE/S96qLIH71OI/AAAAAAAAai0/BhpIBDlv1s0/s400/IMG_4687_2.JPG\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAcá estoy, todavía con el ese sabor de haber logrado una nueva hazaña.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLa historia sigue así: Nosotros llegamos el martes a Heidelberg, y el miércoles a la noche fuimos a lo de Wolfgang (mi amigo monociclista) a buscar mi monociclo para la carrera. Armamos el monociclo con Wolfgang y lo dejamos a punto:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAltura perfecta\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMucha presión en la rueda.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWolfgang me dice: \u003cem\u003e\u0026ldquo;Me fije y esta rueda soporta como máximo 6 PSI, y mi inflador soporta cerca de 6 PSI, así que lo llenamos\u0026rdquo;\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Marathon Düsseldorf 2010 - Relato"},{"content":"Adivine las 7 diferencias entre el Düsseldorf Marathon 2009 vs. 2010:\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2010/05/03/dusseldorf-marathon-20092010/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAdivine las 7 diferencias entre el Düsseldorf Marathon 2009 vs. 2010:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/xQHzUvGQVcJorhvJZ8BYbafYwRgzAYAn4fRorFN3JfQ?feat=embedwebsite\"\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/_7Tp7oCOlWFE/S97LSny4EoI/AAAAAAAAavA/yZwUtJRq120/s400/7diferencias1.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/AmyoR5oJPlIif6S14GuNJafYwRgzAYAn4fRorFN3JfQ?feat=embedwebsite\"\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/_7Tp7oCOlWFE/S97LTQrhDTI/AAAAAAAAavI/D2UjWtNHz1g/s400/7diferencias2.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/SDBD9cVGRbE-FYyaMuos_KfYwRgzAYAn4fRorFN3JfQ?feat=embedwebsite\"\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/_7Tp7oCOlWFE/S97LTyamkRI/AAAAAAAAavQ/GUtP1lxLquo/s400/7diferencias3.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Düsseldorf Marathon 2009 vs. 2010"},{"content":"Increible\u0026hellip; este nuevo mono de 28\u0026quot; es el día y la noche comparado con el viejo mono de 28\u0026quot;.\nDiferencias:\nAsiento: El nuevo tiene un muy buen asiento (KH Freeride 2009).

En esos días estaba en Litunia, donde nos fuimos con Lucio a dar una charla de cocos2d (version python) a EuroPython.

Le envié un mensaje al soporte de Apple pidiendo ayuda.\nAl cabo de una semana de espera, volví a enviar otro mail al soporte de Apple, y como a los 3 ó 4 días volví a enviar un nuevo mail al soporte de Apple.\nEsta vez me respondieron, y me dijeron que haga el tramite off-line, por fax.\nComo aca en Argentina nadie tiene fax (¿qué es un fax?) contraté un servicio de fax-online, y les envié el fax a travéz de este servicio\u0026hellip;. Me costo como 2 dólares.\nAl cabo de unos días de no tener, nuevamente noticias, decidí enviar otro fax, pero esta vez me fuí a la telefonica de enfrente y lo envié usando su fax\u0026hellip; Me costó menos de 1 peso\u0026hellip; que ironia.\nEn fin\u0026hellip; volví a esperar unos días y me contacté con el soporte de Apple nuevamente diciendo que ya había enviado el fax 2 veces y que no tenía respuesta.

Algo pasaba con mi certificado que no era reconocido por Xcode. Luego de buscar ayuda, preguntar en foros y demás decidi revocar mi certificado y empezar la creación de uno nuevo desde cero. Esta vez si funciono.\nEntonces, tenia licencia y certificado. O sea podía distribuir aplicaciones gratis, pero no vender.\nMe faltaba completar la parte del Banco y la parte de los impuestos para poder vender.\nYa era Septiembre y me fuí al banco a que me expliquen que era el SWIFT code, el ABA, el routing y todas esas cosas que no entendía. Completé toda esa parte.\nFaltaba la de los impuestos. Para hacer una operación comercial en EE.UU hay que tener un SSN o un EIN. Como yo no soy ciudadano norteamericano, tuve con sacar un numero EIN.\nPara eso tuve que llenar un formulario y llamar por telefono a la IRS (como la AFIP de aca) y pasarle los datos a ellos por telefono.\nEn seguida me dieron el famoso numerito.

Salió bien. Lo que fué cómico fue conseguir que la MacBook (donde corría cocos2d) pueda ser conectada al proyector.\nResulta que el miércoles pasado me fui a MacOnline (o MacStore o yo que se como se llame) a comprar el adaptador mini-dvi-vga, pero no lo conseguí. Los llamé por telefono 50 veces pero no se dignaron a atender asi que fuí para allá en vano.\nHoy, antes de la charla llamé a Alfa One, y no tenían, y también llamé a Maxim, que me dijeron:\n- \u0026ldquo;Tengo el cable, venite\u0026rdquo;\n- \u0026ldquo;¿Si? Groso che. Me lo reservas?\u0026rdquo;\n- \u0026ldquo;Ah\u0026hellip; no, sabes que se me acabo ayer\u0026rdquo;\u0026hellip; (ja ja, que chantas).\n- \u0026ldquo;¿Y qué tenes?\u0026rdquo;\n-\u0026ldquo;Uno mini-dvi a super-video\u0026rdquo;\n-\u0026ldquo;Bueno\u0026hellip; voy para alla\u0026rdquo;.\nLa cosa es que me compré (al pedo) el mini-dvi a super-video y me fui a la conferencia esperando que algún proyector tenga los cables de super-video.\nLlegué, Alecu me dio una mano buscando los cables de super-video, y preguntando a gente si tenian el cable mini-dvi-vga, aunque no conseguimos.\nLa cosa es que me acerque al stand de el elserver.com ya que había una persona con una MacBook. Le pregunto si tenia de casualidad un cable mini-dvi-vga\u0026hellip; y magicamente saca un cable de su mochila, y era un mini-dvi-a-dvi. Era un paso importante.\nEl miércoles con Alecu teniamos un cable dvi-a-vga, pero nos faltaba el mini-dvi-a-vga.\nAsi que salimos con Alecu a buscar un cable dvi-a-vga.\nLa gente de Ruby nos derivó a Rodolfo Pila que tenia no solamente 1 cable dvi-a-vga, sino que tenia 2!.\nQue alegría la mia. Cuando voy a ver a Ariel Pelerman (la persona que me había ofrecido el cable originalmente), le mostré el cable, hacemos la prueba y no encajaba. \u0026ldquo;Claro\u0026rdquo;, pensé, \u0026ldquo;es que este cable que medio Rodolfo no es de Apple.\u0026rdquo;\nLe pedimos a Rodolfo Pila el otro cable, que era de Apple, pero parece que a Apple le gusta hacer incompatible sus propios cables ya que el mini-dvi-a-dvi no entraba en el dvi-a-vga. Repito: NO ENTRABA. Había 4 pines que tenian que ir a un lugar que estaba tapado en el otro cable.\nPerrito me dijo que tenia uno, lo probamos y no entraba, ya que era para iBook y no MacBook (argh\u0026hellip; Apple y la re-conch de tu hermana).\nEn eso aparece nuevamente Ariel y me dice que si lo necesitaba él podía ir a su casa a buscar su cable mini-dvi-a-vga.\nLes comento a Uds. que yo no lo conocía a Ariel ni él a mi, él no era de la organización, ni nada. Él estaba en el stand de elserver.com. Asi que Ariel se fue a su casa, buscó el cable y a los 30 minutos estaba de vuelta, justo, para que podamos dar la charla con Lucio.\nGracias nuevamente Alecu, Rodolfo Pila, Perrito y especialmente Ariel Perelman!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2008/08/22/maldito-cable-mini-dvi-vga/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/ff/Apple-minidvi-vga.JPG/800px-Apple-minidvi-vga.JPG\"\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/ff/Apple-minidvi-vga.JPG/800px-Apple-minidvi-vga.JPG\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePor Dios,\u003cbr\u003e\nHoy con Lucio dimos una charla sobre \u003ca href=\"http://cocos2d.org/\"\u003ecocos2d\u003c/a\u003e.

El martes 2 de mayo decidí llevar el monociclo al trabajo, así practicaba en el trabajo. Muchos compañeros del trabajo se prendieron y empezamos varios a practicar dentro de la oficina. Andabamos apoyados de la pared y nos caimos enseguida. Al cabo de unos días el que mayores progresos había hecho era Pancho. Y fué él el primero en andar algunos metros dentro de la oficina, luego seguimos Bruce y yo. El día en cuestión fué el glorioso miércoles 16 de mayo. Fué algo mágico\u0026hellip; de repente la cabeza me hizo click y ya no me caía (en los primeros metros). Recuerdo que ese día me había empecinado en bajar el \u0026ldquo;centro de gravedad\u0026rdquo; para tener más control, y parece que funcionó.\u003cbr\u003e\nLos días siguientes era peligroso trabajar en la oficina ya que nosotros, los monociclistas-sin-control, andabamos por los pasillos llevandonos todo por delante. Y fué así, que nos prohibieron andar en la oficina, y nos fuimos a andar al garage\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Mis primeros 5 metros"},{"content":" Creo que mis ganas de tener un monociclo habrán empezado en el año 2001, cuando en Core estaba la fiebre de los malabares.
